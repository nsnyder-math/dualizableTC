\title{Relative Deligne tensor product}

\begin{abstract}
A key role in the theory of tensor categories is played by the relative Deligne tensor product $\cM \boxtimes_\cC \cN$ which is a higher dimensional analogue of the tensor product of a right and a left module over a non-commutative ring.  The relative Deligne tensor product is characterized by a universal property, but such a characterization does not guarantee existence.  In this paper, we give a construction of the relative Deligne tensor product to non-semisimple finite tensor categories (in the sense of Etingof-Ostrik) and their finite module categories.  This generalizes results of Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik (in the semisimple case) and Greenough (who requires an additional technical assumption).  Explicitly, we realize the relative Deligne tensor product as a category of bimodule objects in $\cC$.
