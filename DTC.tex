\subsection{Linear categories}

\begin{definition}
	A linear category $C$ is a {\em retract} of a linear category $D$ if there exists linear functors $r: D \to C$ and $i: C \to D$ such that the composition $r \circ i: C \to C$ is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor of $C$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Kapranov-Voevodsky \cite{KV94}]
	A {\em finite 2-vector space} is a linear category isomorphic to $\bigoplus_I \Vect$,
	 a finite direct sum of the category $\Vect$ with itself. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Tensor products and colimits of linear categories}

\subsection{Tensor category bimodules and bimodule composition}


\CSP{convention on left/right: view S-R-bimodules as functors from R-mod to S-mod.}
\begin{proposition}
	Let $S$ be a tensor categories and let $M$ be a left $S$-module category.  If ${}_S M$ admits a left-adjoint as an $S$-$\Vect$-bimodule category, then $M$ is a retract of a finite 2-vector space. 
	% There is also a version for left module cats... If $(-) \otimes_S M_R$ is a right-adjoint, then ${}_SM$ is a finitely generated projective $S$-module.
\end{proposition}

{\color{CSPcolor} This automatically implies that all homs in M are finite dimensional. I believe that it also implies that M is semi-simple with finitely many simples, hence is a finite 2-vector space (if our ground ring is $\CC$).

This will be used later in the special case that $S = C \boxtimes C^{mp}$ and $M=C$ to prove that a dualizible tensor category is semi-simple with finitely many simples.}

\begin{proof}
	
\end{proof}

\subsection{The 3-category of tensor categories.}

\section{Dualizability and fusion categories}

\subsection{Dualizability in 3-categories}

\subsection{Fusion categories}

\subsection{Fusion categories are dualizable}

\subsubsection{Functors of finite semisimple module categories have duals}

\subsubsection{Indecomposable modules with braided commutant have duals} .\\

	[Prop: Given C fusion, C--M--Vect indecomposable with C' braided, then M has an ambiadjoint.]

\subsubsection{Fusion categories have duals}

\begin{theorem}
	Fusion Categories are fully-dualizable. 
\end{theorem}
	
\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
We must show the following conditions for a Fusion Category C to be fully dualizable: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $C$ must have a dual (it is automatically both a left and right dual, since TC is symmetric monoidal).
		\item The adjunction 1-morphisms (certain bimodule categories) used in the above duality must themselves have duals (both left and right duals), which in turn must themselves have duals, and so on.  In fact, we show that the relevant 1-morphisms have ambidextrous adjoints, so we do not need to worry about an infinite chain of adjunctions.
		\item The adjunctions of the above 1-morphism dualities, must have duals, and their duals must have duals, and so on.  Again, we show that in fact the adjoints are ambidextrous.
	\end{enumerate}

Condition 1: The dual of $C$ is $C^{mp}$ (the one with only the tensor structure opposite). The dualizing bimodule categories are:
\begin{equation*}
	{}_{C \boxtimes C^{mp}} C_{Vect}, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad {}_{Vect} C_{C^{mp} \boxtimes C}	
\end{equation*} 
These satisfy the necessary adjunction for C to be dualizable. 
Condition 2 will be proven by the two propositions below. Note that $C$ is indecomposable as a $C \boxtimes C^{mp}$-module.  
	
Condition 3 was established in the ENO Part II blip `Solution to item (1)'.  It uses the fact that C is semisimple with finitely many simples. 	
	
\end{proof}	
	
\begin{proposition}
	Let $C$ be a fusion category, and let ${}_{C} M_D$ be a bimodule which is $C$-indecomposible. Let $C'$ be the commutant of $C$ acting on $M$, and let $i: D \to C'$ be the induced tensor functor (warning! it may not be an inclusion in the usual sense). Then, the bimodule category ${}_{C} M_{C'}$ is invertible, with inverse ${}_{C'} N_C$ (See Lemma \ref{Lma:}). In this case, 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the maps of bimodules,
	\begin{equation*}
		{C --- M \otimes_D N ---C }  ===> {C --- M x_C' N ---C }  == {C---C ---C}
		{D ---D--- D} ===> {D --- C' ----D} == {D --- N x_C M --- D}
	\end{equation*}	
	form the unit and counit of an (say "left") adjunction between $C--M--D$ and $D--N--C$.
	\item  Moreover, if there exist maps ("conditional expectation maps")
	\begin{align*}
		lambda: D---C'---D  ==> D---D---D \\
		mu: C' --- C' ---C'  ===>  C' --- C' x_D C' --- C' 
	\end{align*}
	making D-- C' ---C' and C' ---C' ---D into a ("right") adjunction, then the composites 
	\begin{align*}	
		{C --- M x_D N ---C }  <=mu== {C --- M x_C' N ---C }  == {C---C ---C}
		{D ---D--- D} <=lambda== {D --- C' ----D} == {D --- N x_C M --- D}
	\end{align*}
	form the units of a ("right") adjucntion between C--M--D and D--N--C.
\end{enumerate}	
\end{proposition}	

\begin{proof}
	...
