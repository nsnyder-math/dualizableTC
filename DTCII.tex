\section*{Sketch scratch}

This purpose of this paper is to explain what it means, cellularly, to give a homotopy $SO(3)$-action on a homotopy 3-type.  That is, you say, $BSO(3)$ has cells $e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5$, where $e_3$ is attached to $e_2$ by $2$, and $e_4$ is attached to $e_2$ by a generator $q: S^3 \ra S^2$ and $e_5$ is attached to $e_3$ by yadda.  And to give a map $BSO(3) \rightarrow BAut(X)$ is to give an element $S \in Map(S^2,BAut(X))$ and a trivialization $A$ of $q S \in Map(S^3,BAut(X))$ and a trivialization $R$ of $2S$ such that a canonical element called $\frac{\eta q S}{2}$ of $\pi_4(BAut(X))$ vanishes.  (Note that the choice of 2-divisor of $\eta q S$ depends on $R$.  Here $\eta: S^4 \ra S^3$ is the generator.)

Along the way, we also discuss what it means to have actions by $Orp(3)$, $SO(2)$, $\Omega S^2$, $\Omega \Sigma \RR P^2$.

\CDcomm{We should also precisely describe the data required to give a G-homotopy fixed point, for each of the discussed groups.  And for each group we should also explicitly describe the map $G \ra Aut(X)$ in terms of the given data defining $BG \ra BAut(X)$.}

\subsection{General remarks}

Why? The cobordism hypothesis tells us that $Hom^{\otimes}(GBord_n,C) = ((dC)^{\sim})^{hG}$, where $dC$ is the maximal symmetric monoidal sub-n-category of C with duals, and the $\sim$ denotes the maximal sub-n-groupoid.  Note that $(dC)^\sim$ is a homotopy $n$-type.  Thus we want to describe explicitly the structure of $G$ actions on $n$-types.  (In fact, the description we give will apply to actions on discrete $n$-categories that are not necessarily $n$-groupoids \CDcomm{(right?)}, but such a case is not relevant for cobordism hypothesis applications and we will not mention it explicitly.)

If $C$ is a discrete $n$-category (eg an $n$-type), let $Aut(C)$ denote the $n$-groupoid of automorphisms of $C$ --- the objects are the automorphisms of $C$ in the discrete $(n+1)$-category of $n$-categories, the morphisms are the automorphisms of automorphisms, etc.  Thus $Aut(C)$ is an $n$-type and $BAut(C)$ is an $(n+1)$-type.  By definition, an action of $G$ on $C$ is a map $BG \ra BAut(C)$.

\subsection{Warmup: $SO(2)$ actions}

An $SO(2)$ action on a 3-type $X$ is a map $\alpha: BSO(2) \ra BAut(X)$.  The 5-skeleton of $BSO(2)$ has cells $e_2$ and $e_4$.  The data of the map $\alpha$ on $e_2$ is an element of $\pi_2(BAut(X)) = \pi_1(Aut(X))$.  We denote this element $S$ and call it the Serre automorphism.  The 4-cell is attached to the 2-cell by $\eta : S^3 \ra S^2$.  The data of an extension of $S$ to the 4-cell and therefore to all of $BSO(2)$ is given by a trivialization of the composite $\eta S : S^3 \ra BAut(X)$.

\begin{proposition}
The composite $\eta S : S^3 \ra BAut(X)$ can be computed as follows: draw a figure 8, read the cap and cup as the equivalences $1 \cong S \cdot S^{-1}$ and $S^{-1} \cdot S \cong 1$ and the cross as the braiding of elements in $2Aut(X)$, and evaluate the picture in $\Omega^2(Aut(X)) \simeq \Omega^3 BAut(X)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\CDcomm{This would be clear stably, but requires explanation unstably.}
\end{proof}

To summarize:

\begin{proposition}
The set of homotopy classes of $SO(2)$ actions on a 3-type $X$ is the set of homotopy classes of pairs $(S,E)$, where $S: S^1 \ra Aut(X)$ is a map and $E : D^3 \ra Aut(X)$ is a null homotopy of the figure 8 composite on $S$.
\end{proposition}

\CDcomm{More explanation is really necessary to even make the statement clear.  Eg, make clear in what sense is the figure 8 composite an actual map to be trivialized rather than merely a homotopy class of maps.  (If it were just a homotopy class, it would look like E is an element of $\pi_3$ of $Aut(X)$, which is wrong, since it lives in a torsor.)  For instance, do this by picking equivalences $\Omega^2(Aut(X)) \simeq \Omega^3 BAut(X)$ etc?}

We can restrict attention to 3-types that happen to be 2-types.

\begin{corollary}
The set of homotopy classes of $SO(2)$ actions on a 2-type $X$ is the set of homotopy classes of maps $S: S^1 \ra Aut(X)$ such that the figure 8 composite on $S$ is null.
\end{corollary}

\section{Introduction}

\section{Cell structures}

\CDcomm{This section is ``pure homotopy theory", ie focuses on determining the cell structures only.  All issues about interpreting the attaching maps and commuting them explicitly are left to later sections.}

\subsection{Of the spaces $B\Omega S^2$ and $B\Quad$}

Though it will form the cornerstone of a homotopy $SO(3)$ action, the space $B\Omega S^2$ requires, at this stage, no comment.

\begin{definition}
The space $B\Quad$ is the homotopy fiber of the map $c_1^2: BSO(2) \ra K(\ZZ,4)$ classifying the square of the first chern class.
\end{definition}



\subsection{Of the space $BSO(2)$}


\subsection{Of the spaces $B \Omega \Sigma \RR P^2$ and $B Orp(3)$}


\subsection{Of the space $BSO(3)$}

\subsubsection{A minimal cell structure}

\subsubsection{A pushout cell structure}

\CDcomm{Give the pushout in terms of $BSO(2)$ and $BOrp(3)$}

\begin{definition}
A commutative square is a pushout of $n$-types if the canonical map from the pushout to the target object is an $n$-equivalence.
\end{definition}

\section{Homotopy actions}

\CDcomm{This section describes the meaning of a homotopy action for each group.  This is where the explicit translation to computable, i.e. categorically readable, expressions occurs.  Also, for each group, the map $G \ra Aut(X)$ is described.}
