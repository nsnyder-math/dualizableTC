\section{Some content}

This purpose of this paper is to explain what it means, cellularly, to give a homotopy $SO(3)$-action on a space.  That is, you say, $BSO(3)$ has cells $e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5$, where $e_3$ is attached to $e_2$ by $2$, and $e_4$ is attached to $e_2$ by $\eta$ and $e_5$ is attached to $e_3$ by yadda.  And to give a map $BSO(3) \rightarrow BAut(X)$ is to give an element $S \in \pi_1(Aut(X))$ and a trivialization $R$ of $2S$ such that the element $\eta(q(S))$ of $\pi_3(Aut(X))$ is trivial, and to give a trivialization $a$ of $q(S) \in \pi_2(Aut(X))$.

Along the way, we also discuss what it means to have actions by $Orp(3)$, $SO(2)$, $\Omega S^2$, $\Omega \Sigma \RR P^2$.
