--Decide between "The structure of tensor categories via local topological field theory" (Noah and CSP prefer) and "Tensor categories and local topological field theory" (CD prefers).

--Do we want a table of contents?

--Finish the introduction once CSP has had a look at it.

--Add CSP's thanks (Jamie and Bruce?)

--Fight about left and right.

--Make sure "twisted bimodule" language is propagated throughout the paper.

--Add some more info about how to translate between bimodule categories and categories of bimodules, in the service of showing that ENO's Radford proof agrees with ours.

--Make sure global dimension statements deal with fusion/multi-fusion issues.

--Add a quick reference for notations at the end of section 2 (e.g. finite = blah, linear = blah, etc.)

--Rewrite exposition in the beginning of Section 3.2.

--CD double-check Section 3.3.

--Write intro paragraph to Section 4.

--Add 3-dimensional example to Section 4.1.

--Example 4.1

--Someone other than me should read my proof of Thm 5.1 and possibly clean it up.

--Put the (m,n)-category notation somewhere in section 3.

--Section 5.3 should give the definition which follows from the original proofs in the first column, and then have the balanced description in the next column.

--Section 5.4 needs to be redone in light of separability.

--check, dual, L, R notation propagation.
