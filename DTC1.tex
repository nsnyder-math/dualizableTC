\title{The structure of tensor categories via local topological field theory}

\begin{abstract}
The Turaev-Viro construction assigns to a spherical fusion category a 3-dimensional topological field theory.  We generalize this construction in three ways. First we construct a fully local 0123 extended TFT.  Second, we relax the assumption of sphericality on the fusion category; an arbitrary fusion category gives a $3$-framed TFT.  Finally, we show that finite tensor categories give a fully extended $3$-framed $2$-dimensional theory.  This correspondence between finite tensor categories and TFTs allows one to translate algebraic statements and arguments into topology and vice-versa.  We give two main examples of this correspondence.  We explain how various adjectives describing fusion categories (e.g. spherical) relate to topological adjectives describing the TFT.  Also, we reprove several theorems about the quadruple dual functor by relating them to the fact that $\pi_1(\mathrm{SO}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2$.

\section{Introduction}

% 1.3. Acknowledgments
An $n$-dimensional topological field theory, according to Atiyah and Segal, is a symmetric monoidal functor from the category of $n$-dimensional bordisms to the category of vector spaces.  Thus, a TFT assigns to any closed $(n-1)$-manifold a vector space, and to any $n$-dimensional bordism it assigns a linear function between the corresponding vector spaces.  In particular, to a closed $n$-manifold a TFT assigns an endomorphism of the trivial vector space, that is a scalar.  Thus, TFTs can be thought of as topological invariants which can be computed by chopping the manifold up into smaller pieces.  A fully local (or fully extended) TFT allows one to cut the manifold not just along codimension one boundaries, but allows boundaries with corners of arbitrary codimension.  To state this rigorously we must understand the structure of cobordisms with corners.  Just as ordinary bordisms from a symmetric monoidal category, bordisms with corners  form a symmetric monoidal $n$-category.  Rigorously, a fully local TFT is a functor of symmetric $n$-categories from the $n$-category of bordisms with corners to another symmetric monoidal $n$-category.  Because points are much simpler than $(n-1)$-manifolds, fully local theories can be easier to understand than ordinary TFTs.

The Turaev--Viro construction (as generalized by Ocneanu and Barrett--Westbury) assigns to any spherical fusion category a 3-dimensional topological field theory.  We generalize this construction in three ways.  First we construct a fully local $0123$ extended TFT.  This local TFT takes values in the $3$-category $\TC$ (whose whose objects, $1$-morphisms, $2$-morphisms, and $3$-morphisms are tensor categories, bimodule categories, functors, and natural transformations, respectively) and the fusion category arises as the image of a point.  Second, we relax the assumption of sphericality on the fusion category.  TFTs come in flavors depending on the topological structure put on the bordism category (e.g. orientation, spin structure, etc.).  An arbitrary fusion category gives a $3$-framed TFT while the additional choice of spherical structure gives an oriented TFT.  Third we relax semisimplicity, to get a fully local categorified $3$-framed $2$-dimensional TFT (in the sense that it is a functor of $(3,2)$-categories).  In fact, this TFT can be defined on certain $3$-dimensional bordisms, which we will address more fully in a future paper.  In addition, we avoid several assumptions that frequently appear in the literature: simplicity of the unit, algebraic closure of the base field, split semisimplicity, and characteristic zero (though in positive characteristic one needs the additional assumption that the global dimension is nonzero).

Each of our three main generalizations is inspired by the cobordism hypothesis (originally proposed by Baez-Dolan, but improved and proved by Lurie) which gives a classification of local TFTs.  This classification states that an $n$-dimensional $n$-framed local field theory is determined (up to isomorphism) by the image of a point, and furthermore the possible images of points are exactly the ``fully dualizable" objects in the target $n$-category.  Finally, other flavors of $n$-dimensional local field theories are given by homotopy fixed points of actions of certain groups on the fully dualizable objects.  In particular, being fully dualizable is a {\bf property} while being a homotopy fixed point is a {\bf choice of structure}.  Note that being fusion is a property (semisimple, finitely many simple objects, duals exist for each object), while being spherical is a structure (choice of natural isomorphism between the identity and the double dual).  Furthermore, finite tensor categories are twice dualizable, and in fact satisfy most of the conditions on being fully dualizable.

Since the most interesting topological information in a TFT are the invariants attached to the high-dimensional pieces, one should not anticipate much in the way of new topological results coming from extending all the way down to points.  Instead, we have interesting applications from topology to algebra.  The generator of $\pi_1(\mathrm{SO}_3)$ corresponds to the interval with a nontrivial $3$-framing.  Lurie calls the image of this generator under the TFT the Serre automorphism.  For our TFT the Serre automorphism is $\cC$ as $\cC$--$\cC$ module category where one of the actions has been twisted by the double dual.  Thus, the fact that $\pi_1(\mathrm{SO}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2$ says something about the quadruple dual functor.  Furthermore, there is a canonical minimal genus $3$-framed $2$-dimensional bordism between the trivial and the square of the Serre depicted below.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{cobordism.png}
\end{center}

If $\cC$ is a finite tensor category, the image of this bordism gives a topological proof of the generalization of Radford's formula stating that the quadruple dual is canonically naturally isomorphic to conjugation by the distinguished invertible object $D$.  In addition, for fusion categories it is easy to see from the topological proof that $D \cong 1$, and thus that the quadruple dual for fusion categories is trivial.  This makes rigorous the intuition (stated in \cite{}) that Radford's theorem is related to the belt trick.    In addition, since this framing on the interval induces the same orientation as the usual framing, finding an oriented field theory requires picking a trivialization of the of Serre.  This explains the appearance of the sphericality condition in the study of oriented field theories.

In addition to the local TFT story, there are two other narratives that this work fits into.  The early history of fusion categories was heavily topological.  However, the topological approach seemed to require extra assumptions (like sphericality for fusion categories or ribbon for braided tensor categories).  In part to avoid these unnecessary assumptions, a more purely algebraic approach to the theory of fusion categories was developed by Etingof, Nikshych, Ostrik, and others.  One of the main points of this paper is that this algebraic approach can be brought back in touch with topology.  In fact, many of the algebraic results turn out to be well motivated from the topological point of view.   The second narrative is that this paper can be thought of as a category theoretic approach to the theory of fusion categories.  The main philosophy of category theory is that instead of studying something by looking inside them at their elements, you can instead study objects by looking outside them at their relationship to other objects.  Thus the category theoretic perspective on fusion categories avoids looking inside the category at the object and morphisms, and instead concentrate on the bimodules between fusion categories.  In this work we fully embrace this perspective, and only look inside the categories to establish a few key results, while the main results are proved by looking at bimodule categories, functors, and natural transformations.

\subsection{Outline and results}

The heart of this paper is Section \ref{sec-dualfusion}, which contains the main results.  The sections prior to that are mostly background, while the sections after that are mostly applications.

In the Section \ref{sec-tc} we rapidly review the theory of finite tensor categories, bimodule categories, and fusion categories, and we prove several key structural lemmas.  Most of the material in this section comes from the work of Etingof, Gelaki, Nikshych, and Ostrik, but we do need a few new modifications of their results.  Readers are encouraged to only skim this section on a first reading, referring back to it when it's applied in the main arguments.

The goal of Section \ref{sec-sym-mon} is to construct a symmetric monoidal $3$-category whose objects are finite tensor categories, morphisms are bimodule categories, $2$-morphisms are functors, and $3$-morphisms are natural transformations.  This result should be a surprise to no one, but even stating this claim requires a robust theory of symmetric monoidal $n$-categories.  We use the theory of iterated complete Segal spaces described by Clark Barwick, \CSP{Get reference. Possible a reference to Simpson's work too?} or more precisely the symmetric monoidal variant thereof.  This is the version of $n$-categories used in Lurie's proof of the cobordism hypothesis, so we can apply his results directly without worrying about whether different notions of $n$-category agree.  This section has a significant amount of expository material about symmetric monoidal $n$-categories, which we hope will make it more accessible to readers coming from topology or algebra.  Readers willing to take the theory of symmetric monoidal $3$-categories as a black box can happily skip this section.
%%

In Section \ref{sec-lft} we discuss local field theory, recall Lurie's statement of the Baez-Dolan cobordism hypothesis, and discuss several topological notions which come up in $3$-dimensional field theory.  We briefly recall the outline of Lurie's proof, indicating how some aspects of it have been simplified by more recent results.  Since the $n$-framed bordisms are critical to the cobordism hypothesis, we then fix some convenient notation for $n$-framings and gives some examples of that notation.  Finally, we discuss some groups which come up as other $3$-dimensional structure groups.  Although parts of this section can be skipped on a first read, we highly recommend that the reader look at the section on notation for $n$-framings  as the diagrams in the rest of the paper are otherwise unintelligible.

In Section \ref{sec-dualfusion} we prove our main result (Theorem \ref{???} for a more detailed statements).

\begin{theorem}
Fusion categories of nonzero global dimension are fully dualizable.
\end{theorem}

%!% Keep this statement this short and snappy in the introduction.  In the main text it can be fleshed out with more precision about the ambient 3-category.

A key application of this theorem is the construction of a plethora of local field theories:
\begin{corollary}
For any fusion category there is a local topological quantum field theory whose value on a point is that fusion category.  Furthermore, this TFT is unique up to equivalence.
\end{corollary}

\NScomm{Figure out what to say about the relationship to Turaev-Viro}

%In particular, the theorem provides localizations of Turaev-Viro field theories:
%\begin{corollary}
%There is a local field theory whose value on a circle is the center of the fusion category of representations of a loop group at (any nondegenerate?) level.
%\end{corollary}
%Of course, the fusion category of representations of a loop group is merely an example, and can be replaced by any fusion category here.  This result is related to recent work of Kirillov and Balsam~\cite{kirillovbalsam}, which constructs a semi-local (that is, $1+1+1$-dimensional) version of Turaev-Viro theory.  In particular, our $0+1+1+1$-dimensional theory has the same value on a circle as the Kirillov-Balsam theory.  
%!% Add?: Assuming widely believed statements about the classification of 123 theories, it follows that our theory agrees with KB on 123 manifolds.
%!% Add mention of how sphericality comes in?

%%

We also prove several intermediate results showing that parts of duality do not require the full fusion assumption.  The most important of these intermediate results is the following.

\begin{theorem}
Finite monoidal categories whose tensor product is biexact, are twice dualizable (that is, fully dualizable in the (3,2) truncation of the $3$-category of finite monoidal categories).
\end{theorem}

This shows that finite monoidal categories give $2$-framed local $2$-dimensional TFTs, which are categorified in the sense that they take values in a $(3,2)$-category instead of a discrete $2$-category.

The end of the paper, Sections~\ref{sec-serre} and~\ref{sec-pivot}, focuses on applications of the main result.  The key player in this section is the Serre automorphism, which roughly measures the dependence of the field theory on spin structures.

\begin{theorem}
The Serre automorphism of a finite monoidal category $\cC$ is the bimodule associated to the double dual functor $**: \cC \ra \cC$.
\end{theorem}

In $3$-dimensions, the Serre automorphism is necessarily order 2 (since $\pi_1(\mathrm{SO}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2$), this theorem provides a simple topological proof of the following generalization Radford's theorem to fusion categories (originally due to ENO).
\begin{corollary}
The quadruple dual functor $****: \cC \ra \cC$ on a fusion category is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor.
\end{corollary}

We then address how this result generalizes to finite tensor categories.  Morally, the key point is that enough of the $2$-morphisms related to finite tensor categories have adjoints that we can define an action of $O(3)$ on these objects instead of just $O(2)$.

\begin{theorem}
There is a canonical $3$-framed local $2$-dimensional field theory attached to a finite tensor category.
\end{theorem}

Indeed we can give a topologically inspired proof of the generalization of Radford' theorem to finite tensor categories (again due to ENO).

\begin{corollary}
The quadruple dual functor $****: \cC \ra \cC$ on a finite tensor category is naturally isomorphic to conjugation by the distinguished invertible object $D$.
\end{corollary}

A key insight resulting from the field-theoretic perspective on fusion categories is that the ENO conjecture, namely that fusion categories are pivotal, is equivalent to the spin-independence of the topological field theories associated to fusion categories:
\begin{theorem}
A fusion category $\cC$ is pivotal if and only if the local field theory associated to $\cC$ is independent of spin structure.
\end{theorem}
A precise formulation of this result, in terms of a descent condition for the bordism structure group of the local field theory, is given in section~\ref{sec-pivot-orpo}.
%\begin{theorem}
%A fusion category $\cC$ is pivotal if and only if the tensor-category-valued local field theory $F_{\cC} : \StringBord_0^3 \ra \TC$ associated to $\cC$ descends to a field theory on oriented $p_1$ bordism.
%\end{theorem}

\subsection{Relationship to other work}

The history of local field theories is somewhat complicated, as the language took some time to catch up to the results.  Some versions of a $123$ extended field theory go back quite early in the literature, where the $12$ part of the theory is called a ``modular functor."  In particular, Turaev's book can be thought of as giving a $123$ extended field theory attached to a modular tensor category.  However, the assumption that the category be modular (or even braided) was too strong.  See also, Bakalov--Kirillov and Kerler-Lyubashenko for early versions of $123$ field theories (in those cases related to Reshetikhin--Turaev instead of Turaev--Viro).  A rigorous $123$ version of Turaev--Viro in modern language is given in the work of Balsam--Kirillov.  Finally, Kevin Walker's work gives a fully local version of the Turaev--Viro TFT, but in somewhat different language which is more difficult to relate to the more usual notions of $n$-categories.

All of the above work on extended field theories assumes sphericality in an essential way.  The history of framed field theories is a bit different.  Here the main precursors are the theory of spin TFTs (Sawin, Blanchet, etc.), and Kuperberg.

The history of Radford's theorem is almost entirely algebraic (Radford, ENO, ENO).  [But say something about Hagge-Hong.]

\subsection{Future directions}

There are several interesting directions we hope to take this project in, which we briefly summarize here.

First, as we note at several points in the paper, finite tensor categories give a field theory which is defined on certain kinds of $3$-dimensional bordisms, but not all $3$-dimensional bordisms.  Such field theories are called non-compact [Lurie].  In order to make this precise we need a non-compact analogue of the cobordism hypothesis.  We plan to consider this in future work.

Second, it is natural to conjecture that multi-fusion categories of nonzero dimension are the only fully dualizable tensor categories.  This paper contains a weak version of this result, namely that a finite tensor category is fully dualizable if and only if its center is semisimple.  However, dualizability should imply finite and rigid.  We have avoided addressing the stronger version of that result in this paper because in order to get a strong result we should work in a larger version of the $3$-category (which does not assume that the objects are finite or even abelian).  This introduces technical issues which we avoid in this paper.

Third, we do not prove in this paper that our $3$-manifold invariants actually agree with Turaev--Viro in the spherical case.  This involves several nontrivial calculations which would distract from the main points of the paper.  We do note that by the uniqueness part of the cobordism hypothesis, the construction of a fully extended version of Turaev--Viro via other techniques (Balsam--Kirillov, Kitaev--Kong) would automatically show that our construction also gives Turaev--Viro.  We hope in the future to give a more direct proof that our $3$-manifold invariants can be computed by state-sums.

Finally, there are various facts about Turaev--Viro invariants which we would like to generalize to the non-spherical setting.  Most notably, we conjecture in the end of this paper several ``anomaly vanishing" results.

In this section we quickly review the theory of finite tensor categories and some related important definitions and results concerning module categories and the Deligne tensor product.  Most of this section is either standard or taken from the works of Etingof, Gelaki, Nikshych and Ostrik.  There are a few results in this section which are somewhat new (Theorem \ref{thm:DelignePrdtOverATCExists} and Lemma \ref{Lma:FunctorsAsATensorPdt}) as well as a several well-known results whose proofs do not appear in the literature.

\subsection{Linear categories and tensor categories} \label{sec-tc-lincat}

\CSP{How do people feel about me putting right exactness into the definition of linear functor?} \CD{Can we add here a word about why, that might assuage readers who think it odd?} \NS{I'm somewhat unhappy about it.}
	Let $k$ be a fixed ground field, let $\overline{\Vect}_k$ be the category of (possibly infinite dimensional) $k$-vector spaces, and $\Vect_k$ be the category of finite dimensional $k$-vector spaces.   A {\em linear category} is an abelian category with a compatible enrichment over $\overline{\Vect}_k$, the category of (possibly infinite dimensional) $k$-vector spaces. 
A {\em linear functor} is a right exact additive functor, which is also a functor of $\overline{\Vect}_k$-enriched categories. 
	
More generally if $\{\cA_\alpha\}$ denotes a collection of linear categories then a {\em multilinear functor} from $\{\cA_\alpha\}$ into a linear category $\cB$ consists of a functor
\begin{equation*}
	F: \prod \cA_\alpha \to \cB
\end{equation*}
such that $F$ is linear in each variable separately. A linear category will be said to {\em have enough projectives} if every simple object has a projective cover. 

\begin{warning}
	Unless otherwise stated {\em all linear functors considered in this paper are {\bf right exact} functors}.  We are aware that this deviates from convention, and offer the following justification. Many of the construction that will be described in this paper, such as the Deligne tensor product of linear categories and the composition of bimodule categories, are only functorial with respect to right exact functors. To avoid littering this paper with the adjective `right exact' it is simpler to define right exactness into the category from the start.  
\end{warning}

\begin{definition}
	A {\em tensor category} is a linear monoidal category $(\cC, \otimes, 1, \alpha, \lambda, \rho)$ such that the functor $\otimes$ is multilinear. A {\em tensor functor} is a monoidal functor which is also linear.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	Both $\overline{\Vect}_k$ and $\Vect_k$ (the category of finite dimensional vector spaces) are examples of tensor categories. If $A$ is an algebra in $\Vect_k$, then the categories of finitely presented left and right modules, $\Mod{A}{}$ and $\Mod{}{A}$, are linear categories. More generally, if $\cC$ is a tensor category and $A$ is an algebra object in $\cC$ (also known as a monoid object), then the categories $\Mod{A}{}(\cC)$ and $\Mod{}{A}(\cC)$ of left and right $A$-module objects in $\cC$ are also linear categories.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	If $\cM$ is a linear category, then the category of (right exact) linear endofunctors $\Fun(\cM, \cM)$ is a tensor category. 
\end{example}

Given a monoidal category $\cC$, there are three important notions of opposite. We can reverse the order of tensor product, reverse the order of composition, or reverse both.  We will denote these $\cC^{\op}$ (the opposite category), $\cC^{\mp}$ (the monoidally-opposite category), and $\cC^{\mop}$ (the opposite monoidally-opposite category).
%We will denote by $\cC^{\op}$ the monoidal category whose underlying category is opposite to the underlying  category of $\cC$, and whose monoidal structure is inherited from the monoidal structure of $\cC$; we call it the {\em opposite monoidal category}.  By contrast, we will let $\cC^{\mp}$ denote the monoidal category whose underlying category is the underlying category of $\cC$, and whose monoidal structure is defined by $[a] \otimes [b] := [b \otimes a]$, where $[a]$ refers to the object $a \in \cC$ viewed as an object of $\cC^{\mp}$; we call this the {\em monoidal opposite category}.  Finally, there is $\cC^{\mop}$, which denotes the monoidal category whose underlying  category is $\cC^{\op}$ and whose monoidal structure is inherited from the monoidal structure of $\cC^{\mp}$; we call this the {\em opposite monoidal opposite category}.

\begin{definition}
	An object $x$ of a monoidal category $\cC$ {\em admits a left dual} if there exists an object $x^*$ (a {\em left dual}) and morphisms, the {\em unit} $\eta: 1 \to x \otimes x^*$ and the {\em counit} $\varepsilon: x^* \otimes x \to 1$, satisfying the following pair of `Zig-Zag' equations:
	\begin{align*}
		(id_{x} \otimes \varepsilon  ) \circ (  \eta \otimes id_{x}) &= id_{x} \\
		(\varepsilon \otimes id_{x^*}) \circ (id_{x^*} \otimes \eta) &= id_{x^*}.
	\end{align*}
The object $x$ {\em admits a right dual} (denoted ${}^*x$) if it admits a left dual in $\cC^{mp}$. Finally, a monoidal category is {\em rigid} if every object admits both left and right duals. 
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	The potentially confusing notation $x^*$ for the {\em left} dual of $x$ is a product of the confluence of two equivalent notions of duality, one coming from work on monoidal categories and the other coming from the notion of adjoint functor.  A convenient mnemonic is to think of the $*$ as eating things.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
	For a fixed object $x$ which admits a left dual, there is an obvious category whose objects $(x^*, \eta, \varepsilon)$ consist of those left duals, with choices of unit and counit maps. This category is easily shown to be {\em contractible} (equivalent to the terminal category). Hence the choice of a left dual is unique up to unique isomorphism. In particular there are canonical isomorphism ${}^*(x^*) \cong ({}^*x)^* \cong x$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma} \label{lma:RigidIsExact}
	Let $(\cC, \otimes)$ be a rigid tensor category. Then the multilinear functor $\otimes: \cC \times \cC \to \cC$ is exact in both variables. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The units and counits give rise to natural isomorphisms \NS{Currently we have both $\hom$ and $\Hom$ in the paper.  We should pick one.}
 \begin{equation*} 
 	\hom(x \otimes y, z) \cong \hom( x, z \otimes y^*) \cong \hom(y, {}^*x \otimes z).
 \end{equation*}
	Hence for all $x$ and $y$ the functors $(-)\otimes x$ and $y \otimes (-)$ admit both left and right adjoints, and are consequently exact. 
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	A $\cC$ a rigid tensor category is semisimple if and only if $1 \in \cC$ is a projective object. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	A semisimple linear category is one in which every object is projective, in particular the unit object. Thus it is enough to show if $1 \in \cC$ is projective, then every object is projective. This follows since $\hom(P, -) = \hom( 1, (-) \otimes P^*)$ is an exact functor. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	The assignments $x \mapsto x^*$ and $x \mapsto {}^*x$ gives rise to equivalences of rigid tensor categories $(-)^*: \cC \to \cC^{mop}$ and ${}^*(-): \cC \to \cC^{mop}$. Consequently the assignment $x \mapsto x^{**}$ gives an autoequivalence of any rigid tensor category. 
\end{lemma}

%\begin{proposition}
%If $\cC$ is a fusion category, then there exist monoidal functors $\ld{(-)} : \cC \ra \cC^{\mop}$ and $\rd{(-)} : \cC \ra \cC^{\mop}$ whose values on any object $a \in \cC$ are respectively a left dual object $\ld{(a)}$ and a right dual object $\rd{(a)}$ for $a$.
%\end{proposition} \CD{This proposition doesn't actually depend on fusion, right?  Should change the statement so that only what is needed (existence of duals) is assumed.}

\begin{proof}
Let $\otimes$ denote the tensor product on $\cC$ and $\cdot$ the tensor product on $\cC^{\mop}$, so that $x \cdot y = y \otimes x$.

First we construct the functor ${(-)^*}$.  Define ${(-)^*}$ on objects by picking for each object $a \in \cC$ a left dual object ${a^*} \in \cC$.  Also pick a unit map $\eta_a: 1 \ra a \otimes {a^*}$ and a counit map  $\varepsilon_a: {a^*} \otimes a \ra 1$  giving ${a^*}$ the structure of a left dual to $a$.  Define the functor ${(-)^*}$ on a morphism $f: a \ra b$ to be its {\em mate}: 
\begin{equation*}
	{(f)^*} := (\varepsilon_b \otimes \id_{\rd{a}}) (\id_{\rd{b}} \otimes f \otimes \id_{\rd{a}}) (\id_{\rd{b}} \otimes \eta_a).
\end{equation*}

Next we want to construct a monoidal functor structure on $(-)^*$, that is we need natural transformations $f_{a,b}: (a \otimes b)^* \rightarrow a^* \cdot b^* = b^* \otimes a^*$.  Since the left dual is unique up to unique isomorphism, it is enough to check that $b^* \otimes a^*$ is a left dual to $b \otimes a$.  Observe that the morphisms $\rd{b} \otimes \rd{a} \otimes a \otimes b \xra{\varepsilon_a} \rd{b} \otimes b \xra{\varepsilon_b} 1$ and $1 \xra{\eta_a} a \otimes \rd{a} \xra{\eta_b} a \otimes b \otimes \rd{b} \; \rd{a}$ show that $(\rd{b} \otimes \rd{a})$ is a left dual to $(a \otimes b)$.  There is therefore a uniquely determined isomorphism from $(\rd{b} \otimes \rd{a})$ to $\rd{(a \otimes b)}$.  It is straightforward to check that this satisfies the necessary hexagon relation.

The right dual functor is analogous.  Since the left and right duals are quasi-inverse to each other, they're each equivalences.
% In principle, need to check naturality and hexagon for those isos.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
Applying this theorem to $\cC^{\op}$ shows that the left dual and the right dual each give monoidal equivalences between $\cC^{\op}$ and $\cC^{\mp}$.  Nonetheless, these equivalences are not canonical (indeed there are two natural choices), so we will always be careful to distinguish  $\cC^{\op}$ and $\cC^{\mp}$.
\end{remark}


% This fact is asserted in Bruce's thesis; the functor part is mentioned in Selinger Eg 4.4.


%\begin{remark}
%The monoidal functor $\ld{(-)}: \cC \ra \cC^{\mop}$ is an equivalence of tensor categories; the inverse functor is $\rd{(-)}: \cC^{\mop} \ra \cC$.
%\end{remark}

\subsection{Bimodule categories}

\begin{definition}
	Let $\cC$ and $\cD$ be tensor categories. A {\em $\cC$-$\cD$-bimodule category} is a bicategory with two objects $x$ and $y$ such that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item all hom categories are linear categories, 
		\item horizontal composition is multilinear, and
		\item there are identifications of monoidal categories $\hom(x,x) \simeq \cD$, $\hom(y,y) \simeq \cC$, and $\hom(y,x) \simeq \emptyset$.
	\end{itemize}
	We will often abuse notation and refer to the value $\cM = \hom(x,y)$ as the bimodule category. If $\cD \simeq \Vect_k$, then $\cM$ is a {\em left module category}. If $\cC \simeq \Vect_k$, then $\cM$ is a {\em right module category}.
\end{definition}
	
Unwrapping this definition we see that a left $\cC$-module category is a linear category $\cM$ together with a multilinear functor $\otimes^{\cM}: \cC \times \cM \to \cM$ and natural isomorphisms
%	\CSP{This looks a little gross. I should change it.}
	\begin{align*}
		\alpha: & \;    \otimes^{\cM} \circ (\otimes \times id_{\cM}) \cong  \otimes^{\cM} \circ (id_{\cC} \times \otimes^{\cM}) \\
		\lambda: & \; 1 \otimes^{\cM}(-) \cong id_{\cM},
	\end{align*}
%	\begin{align*}
%		\alpha: & \;    [(-) \otimes (-)] \otimes^{\cM} (-)  \cong  (- ) \otimes^{\cM} [ (-) \otimes^{\cM} (-)] \\
%		\lambda: & \; 1 \otimes^{\cM}(-) \cong id_{\cM},
%	\end{align*}	
	satisfying the evident pentagon and triangle identities. 

\begin{definition}		
A {\em $\cC$-$\cD$ bimodule functor} $F:\cM \to \cN$ is a (strong) functor of bicategories such that 
\NS{I got rid of the more general definition, if you had a reason you needed it, feel free to change it back}
\CSP{Yes we need this generality to express the universal property of the tensor product of a $\cC$-$\cD$-bimodule  and a $\cC'$-$\cD'$-bimodule.}
%	\begin{itemize}
		 $F$ is the identity on objects,
		  the restriction of $F$ to each hom category is linear,
		 and $F$ is the identity on $\Hom(x,x)$ and $\Hom(y,y)$.
%	\end{itemize}
A {\em lax} (resp. {\em oplax}) bimodule functor is a lax (resp. oplax) functor of bicategories satisfying the above conditions. All bimodule functors will be assumed strong unless otherwise stated. 
	A {\em bimodule transformation} is a transformation of functors of bicategories, which restricts to the identity on $\Hom(x,x)$ and $\Hom(y,y)$, and such that the component 1-cells are trivial.  
\end{definition}
	
%
Bimodule categories, functors, and transformations form a strict 2-category.
%If $\cM$ and $\cN$ are both $\cC$-$\cD$ bimodule categories, then a bimodule functor which restricts to the identity functor on $\cC$ and $\cD$ will be called a {\em $\cC$-$\cD$-bimodule functor}.

\begin{example}
	Every linear category is a $\Vect_k$-$\Vect_k$-bimodule category in an essentially unique way. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	For any algebra object $A$ in a tensor category $\cC$ the categories $\Mod{}{A}(\cC)$ and $\Mod{A}{}(\cC)$ are respectively left and right $\cC$-module categories. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Let $\cM$ and $\cN$ be left $\cC$-module categories. The categories $\Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cM)$ and $\Fun_{\cC}(\cN, \cN)$ of (right exact) $\cC$-module endofunctors is a tensor category. The linear category $\Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cN)$ is a $\Fun_{\cC}(\cN, \cN)$-$\Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cM)$-bimodule category. 
	%\CSP{Do I have the right convention for the actions here?} \NS{I think you got it backwards.  $\Fun(\cM,\cM)$ left acts on $\cM$ and so its action by precompostion should be a right action} 
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
 	Every left $\cC$-module category is naturally a right $\cC^{mp}$-module category. 
\end{remark}

We will also need a slightly more general notion of bimodule morphism to make sense of multilinear bimodule maps. These in turn are used to define the external Deligne tensor product of bimodule categories and, later,  in defining the symmetric monoidal 3-category of tensor categories. 

\begin{definition}
	A {\em twisted bimodule functor} from a $\cC$-$\cD$-bimodule category $\cM$  to $\cC'$-$\cD'$-bimodule category $\cM'$ is a functor of bicatgories from $\cM$ to $\cM'$ which restricts to the identity on objects and is linear on hom categories. A {\em twisted bimodule transformation} between twisted bimodule functors is a transformation of functors of bicategories such that the component 1-cells are trivial.
\end{definition}

Thus a twisted bimodule functor from a $\cC$-$\cD$-bimodule category $\cM$ to a $\cC'$-$\cD'$-bimodule category $\cM'$ consists in part of tensor functors $f:\cC \to \cC'$ and $g:\cD \to \cD'$, and a map of linear categories $\cM \to \cM'$, compatible with the induced module structures. We will say the the twisted bimodule functor {\em extends the tensor functors $f$ and $g$}. 

If we are given a $\cC'$-$\cD'$-bimodule category $\cM'$ and tensor functors $f:\cC \to \cC'$ and $g:\cD \to \cD'$, then we may also form the {\em twisted bimodule category} ${}_f{\cM'}_g$.
\CSP{This notation should made compatible with section 6, once we've settled what to do. }
The underlying linear category of ${}_f{\cM'}_g$ is $\cM'$, but the actions are by $\cC$ and $\cD$ via the tensor functors $f$ and $g$. A twisted bimodule functor $\cM \to \cM'$ extending $f$ and $g$ is the same as a $\cC$-$\cD$-bimodule functor $\cM \to {}_f{\cM'}_g$. 

With twisted bimodule functors as morphisms, there exists a terminal bimodule category $\cT$. As a bicategory, each of its non-empty hom categories is the terminal linear category. The product of bimodule categories $\cM \times_{\cT} \cM'$ is defined as the fiber product of bicategories over $\cT$. We will abuse notation and write this as $\cM \times \cM'$. This is again a bicategory with precisely two objects $x$ and $y$. Moreover
\begin{equation*}
	\Hom_{\cM \times \cM'}(a,b) = \Hom_\cM(a,b) \times \Hom_{\cM'}(a,b)
\end{equation*}
for all pairs $a,b \in \{ x,y \}$.

If $\{ \cM_\alpha \}$ is a collection of bimodule categories then a {\em twisted multilinear bimodule functor} from $\{ \cM_\alpha \}$ into a bimodule category $\cN$ is a functor of bicategories
\begin{equation*}
	\prod_{\alpha} \cM_\alpha \to \cN
\end{equation*}
which is the identity on objects, and which is a twisted bimodule functor in each variable. 

\subsection{The Deligne tensor product and finite linear categories}

The goal of this section is to construct the Deligne tensor product, which takes module categories $\cM_\cC$ and ${}_\cC \cN$ and returns a linear category $\cM \boxtimes_\cC \cN$.  This tensor product only makes sense for categories satisfying certain smallness properties, so we first introduce the notion of finite tensor categories and discuss their properties.

\begin{definition} % This is from EGNO Definition 1.18.2.
	A linear category $\cC$ is {\em finite} if 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\cC$ has finite dimensional spaces of morphisms;
		\item every object of $\cC$ has finite length;
		\item $\cC$ has enough projectives, i.e. every simple object of $\cC$ has a projective cover; and
		\item there are finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects.  
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
A linear category is finite if and only if it is equivalent to the category $\Mod{A}{}$ of finite dimensional modules over a finite dimensional $k$-algebra $A$.
\end{remark}

The key property of finite tensor categories is that they satisfy the following analog of the adjoint functor theorem.  Although this result is well known, we were unable to find a proof in the literature, so we sketch the proof here.

\begin{proposition}
	Let $\cC$ and $\cD$ be finite linear categories and let $\cG: \cC \rightarrow \cD$  be an additive $\Vect$-enriched functor (not necessarily right exact). Then the following conditions are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\cG$ is left exact;  
		\item $\cG$ is left exact and satisfies the following {\em Solution Set Condition:} \\  For each $d \in \cD$ there is a finite set $I$ and a collection of arrows $f_i:d \to \cG(c_i)$ such that every arrow $h:d \to \cG(c)$ can be written as a composite $h = \cG(t) \circ f_i$ for some index $i \in I$ and some $t: c_i \to c$; 
		\item $\cG$ admits an (additive, ${\Vect}$-enriched) left adjoint.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} This is a variation of the proof given in \cite[V.6.Thm 2]{MR0354798}.
Suppose that $\cG$ admits a left adjoint, $\cF$. Then $\cG$ is itself a right adjoint and hence commutes with all limits. In particular $\cG$ is a left exact functor. Moreover, as $\cF$ commutes with coproducts, it is automatically additive, and as the unit and counit maps are linear maps of vector spaces, $\cF$ is also $\overline{\Vect}$-enriched. 


To construct a left adjoint for $\cG$, it suffices (and is necessary) to construct for each $d \in \cD$ a universal arrow $d \to \cG(c)$ (i.e. initial object of the comma category $(d \downarrow \cG)$),
as the left adjoint may then be constructed pointwise as $\cF(d) = c$. To this end, fix $d \in \cD$ and suppose that $\cG$ satisfies the solution set condition. Define the element $w$ of the comma category as the product of the $d \to \cG(c_i)$. Since $\cG$ is left exact, it commutes with finite limits, and hence the forgetful functor $(d \downarrow \cG) \to \cC$ creates limits. In particular the comma category has all finite limits, and this  product exists and is given explicitly by 
\begin{equation*}
	w = \bigoplus_i f_i :  d \to \cG( \oplus_i c_i) = \bigoplus_i \cG(c_i).
\end{equation*}
The morphism spaces of $(d \downarrow \cG)$ are finite dimensional vector spaces, and so we may choose a finite basis for $\hom(w,w)$. Let $v$ be defined as the equalizer of this finite collection of maps. Again, this finite limit exists and may be created in $\cC$. By construction $v$ actually equalizes {\em all} endomorphisms of $w$, and thus by a straightforward calculation [MacLane V.6.Thm 1], we see that $v$ is initial. 

Finally, if $\cG$ is left exact, then it satisfies the solution set condition. To see this note that each object $d \in \cD$  has a finite number of distinct quotients in $\cD$, hence also a finite number quotients of the form  $\cG(c)$ for some $c \in \cC$. Thus we may choose a finite index set $I$ and objects  $c_i \in \cC$, together with maps $d \to \cG(c_i)$ exhausting the finite collection of possible quotients of $d$. Since any map $d \to \cG(c)$ must factor through one of these quotients, we have construct a solution set.   
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	A linear functor between finite linear categories always admits a right adjoint (which may not be a linear functor as we have defined it; it may fail to be right exact). If the linear functor is left exact, then it also admits a left adjoint which is also a linear functor. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	The second statement is just a rephrasing of the above proposition; the first follows by passing to the opposite linear category.  
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}
If $\cC$ is finite, a functor $G: \cC^\textrm{op} \to \Vect$ is representable if and only if it is left exact. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	A representable functor $\hom(-, x):\cC^\text{op} \to \Vect$ sends all limits in $\cC^\text{op}$ (i.e. colimits in $\cC$) to limits in $\Vect$. Hence it is left exact. 
%
% 0 <-- C <--  B <--- A <-- 0 in C/C^op
% 0 -->  \Hom(c,x) ---> hom(b,x) ---> hom(a, x)
%		
Conversely, if $G: \cC^\text{op} \to \Vect$ is left exact, then by the above proposition it admits a left adjoint $F$. Thus for every every object $c \in \cC$ we have a natural isomorphism:
	\begin{equation*}
		G(c) \cong \hom_{\Vect_k}( k, G(c)) \cong \hom_{\cC^op}( F(k), c) = \hom_{\cC}(c, F(k) ).
	\end{equation*}
	In other words,  the object $F(k)$ represents the functor $G$. 
\end{proof}

Just as any finite tensor category is a category of modules over an algebra, any finite module category over a tensor category is a category of module objects over an algebra object.  This is one of the main theorems of \cite{???}[EGNO], and is essential to the structure theory of finite tensor categories.  The key construction underlying their proof is Ostrik's notion of the internal Hom for module categories.

\begin{theorem}[ \cite{???}EGNO 2.11.6(i)] \label{thm:EGNO2.11.6}
	Let $\cM$ be a left module category over the finite tensor category $\cC$. If $\cM$ is finite as a linear category, then there exists an algebra object $A \in \cC$ such that $\cM \simeq \Mod{}{A} (\cC)$ as left $\cC$-module categories. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
	Let $\cM$ be a right $\cC$-module category and $\cN$ a left $\cC$-module category. A {\em $\cC$-balanced functor} into a linear category $\cL$ is a multilinear functor $\cM \times \cN \to \cL$ together with a natural isomorphism $\otimes^{\cM} \times id_{\cN} \cong id_{\cM} \times \otimes^{\cN}$ satisfying the evident pentagon identity. A {\em $\cC$-balanced transformation} is a natural transformation $\eta:F \to G$ of $\cC$-balanced functors such that the following diagram commutes for all $M \in \cM$, $C \in \cC$, and $N \in \cN$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (LT) at (0, 1) {$F(M \otimes^{\cM} C, N)$};
	\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$G(M \otimes^{\cM} C, N)$};
	\node (RT) at (3, 1) {$F(M, C \otimes^{\cN} N)$};
	\node (RB) at (3, 0) {$G(M, C \otimes^{\cN} N)$};
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$$} (LB);

	%\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
	%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
\end{tikzpicture}.
\end{center}
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
	Let $\cA$ and $\cB$ be right and left $\cC$-module categories, respectively. The {\em Deligne tensor product $\cA \boxtimes_{\cC} \cB$} is the universal linear category admitting a $\cC$-balanced multilinear functor $\boxtimes_{\cC}: \cA \times \cB \to \cA \boxtimes_{\cC} \cB$. That is, there exists a $\cC$-balanced multilinear functor $\boxtimes_{\cC}: \cA \times \cB \to \cA \boxtimes_{\cC} \cB$ which induces, for all linear categories $\cD$, an equivalence between the categories of $\cC$-balanced multilinear functors $\cA \times \cB \to \cD$ and linear functors $\cA \boxtimes_{\cC} \cB \to \cD$. 
\end{definition}

If it exists, the Deligne tensor product is unique up to an equivalence, which in turn is unique up to unique natural isomorphism. Equivalently, the 2-category of linear categories representing the Deligne tensor product is either contractible or empty. 

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:DelignePrdtOverATCExists}
	Let $\cC$ be a finite tensor category and let $\cA_{\cC}$ and ${}_{\cC}\cB$ be finite right and left $\cC$-module categories, respectively. Then,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Deligne tensor product $\cA \boxtimes_{\cC} \cB$ exists and is a finite linear category;
		\item If $\cA = \Mod{A}{}(\cC)$ and $\cB = \Mod{}{B}(\cC)$, then $\cA \boxtimes_{\cC} \cB \simeq \Mod{A }{B}(\cC)$;
	\end{enumerate} 
Moreover if $\cC$ is rigid, then 	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(3)] The functor $\boxtimes_{\cC}$ is exact in each variable and satisfies 
		\begin{equation*}
			\hom_{\cA}(x,x') \otimes \hom_{\cB}(y, y') \cong \hom_{\cA \boxtimes_{\cC} \cB} (x \boxtimes_{\cC} y, x' \boxtimes_{\cC} y'),
		\end{equation*}
		\item[(4)] If $F: \cA \times \cB \to \cD$ is a $\cC$-balanced multilinear functor which is exact in each variable, then it defines an exact functor $\overline{F}: \cA \boxtimes_{\cC} \cB \to \cD$. 
	\end{enumerate} 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	When $\cC = \Vect_k$, this is classical \cite[Prop 5.13]{MR1106898} (see also \cite{???}[EGNO 1.46.2]).
	By Theorem \ref{thm:EGNO2.11.6} to show (1) and (2) it is enough to assume that $\cA = \Mod{A}{}(\cC)$ and $\cB = \Mod{}{B}(\cC)$ and show that $\Mod{A }{B}(\cC)$ has the desired universal property. Tensoring a left $A$-module and a right $B$-module gives a canonical $\cC$-balanced multilinear functor 
		\begin{equation*}
			T: \Mod{A}{}(\cC) \times \Mod{}{B}(\cC) \to \Mod{A}{B}(\cC),  
		\end{equation*}
and we will show that $T$ induces an equivalence between $\cC$-balanced multilinear functors $\cA \times \cB \to \cD$ and linear functors out of $\Mod{A}{B}(\cC)$.
	
	To this end, let $F:\Mod{}{A}(\cC) \times \Mod{B}{}(\cC) \to \cD$ be a $\cC$-balanced multilinear functor.  
	There is a unique right exact linear functor $\overline F: \Mod{B}{A}(\cC) \to \cA$ such that $F = \overline{F} \circ T$ which is defined as follows. On free bimodules $A \otimes X \otimes B \cong T(A \otimes X, B)$, we necessarily have $\overline{F}(A \otimes X \otimes B) \cong F(A \otimes X, B)$. Since  every $A$-$B$-bimodule $X$ is a coequalizer of free $A$-$B$-bimodules, namely the canonical coequalizer  
	\begin{equation*}
		X \leftarrow A \otimes X \otimes B \leftleftarrows A \otimes A \otimes X \otimes B \otimes B,
	\end{equation*}
	and since $\overline{F}$ is right exact the result follows.
	
	If $\cC$ is rigid, then by Lemma \ref{lma:RigidIsExact} the functor $T = \boxtimes_{\cC}$ is exact in each variable. The formula in (3) then follows as a standard exercise in using duals. Finally let $F: \cA \times \cB \to \cD$ be a $\cC$-balanced multilinear functor which is exact in each variable and let $\overline{F}: \cA \boxtimes_\cC \cB \to \cD$ be its linear extension (which is always right exact). Since $F$ is exact in each variable, $\overline{F}$ preserves left exact sequences of free $A$-$B$-bimodules (where the maps are also free). Since every $A$-$B$-bimodule has a functorial resolution by free $A$-$B$-bimodules (coming from the above mentioned coequalizer), a diagram chase shows that $\overline{F}$ is also left exact. Hence (4) is also satisfied. 
\end{proof}


%\begin{proposition}[]
%	Let $\cA$ and $\cB$ be finite linear categories. Then,
%	\begin{enumerate}

%\end{proposition}


\begin{remark}
	We may use the case $\cC= \Vect_k$ to rewrite part the data  of a tensor category as a linear category $\cD$ equipped with an object $1 \in \cD$ and a linear functor $\otimes: \cD \boxtimes \cD \to \cD $, together with natural transformations $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\rho$, as before. 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
	If ${}_{\cD}\cA_{\cC}$ and ${}_{\cC}\cB_{\cE}$ are bimodule categories, then the actions of $\cD$ and $\cE$ induce a $\cD$-$\cE$-module category structure on $\cA \boxtimes_{\cC} \cB$. This bimodule category satisfies the analogous universal property for $\cC$-balanced, twisted bilinear bimodule functors. 
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma} \label{Lma:FunctorsAsATensorPdt}
	If $\cC$ is a finite tensor category and $\cM$ and $\cN$ are finite left $\cC$-module categories then the natural functor induces an equivalence
	\begin{equation*}
		\Fun_\cC(\cM, \cC) \boxtimes_\cC \cN \simeq \Fun_\cC(\cM,\cN).
	\end{equation*}
	Here $\Fun_\cC$ denotes the category of (right exact) $\cC$-module functors. 
	Moreover, if $\cM$ and $\cN$ are bimodule categories, then the above equivalence is a bimodule equivalence. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The last sentence follows since in that case the natural functor is a bimodule functor. By the Theorem \ref{thm:EGNO2.11.6}, there exist algebra objects $A, B \in \cC$ and equivalences $\cM \simeq \Mod{}{A}(\cC)$ and $\cN \simeq \Mod{}{B}(\cC)$. We show that both sides of the above equation are naturally equivalent to $\Mod{A}{B}(\cC)$, the category of $A$-$B$-bimodule objects in $\cC$. The equivalence $\Fun_\cC(\cM, \cN) \simeq \Mod{A}{B}(\cC)$ (\cite[Prop 2.12.2]{EGNO}) can be seen by mirroring the classical proof. A bimodule clearly gives rise to such a functor, and given a functor $f$, we obtain an $A$-$B$-bimodule $f(A)$. By $\cC$-linearity $f(X \otimes A) \cong X \otimes f(A)  \cong (X \otimes A) \otimes_A f(A) $ is determined on free $A$-modules. Since every object of $\cM$ may be written as a (canonical) coequalizer of free $A$-modules,
	\begin{equation*}
		M \leftarrow M \otimes A \leftleftarrows M \otimes A \otimes A
	\end{equation*} 
the functor $f$ is equivalent to the one determined by the bimodule $f(A)$. Thus the natural map  $\Mod{A}{B}(\cC) \to \Fun_\cC(\cM, \cN)$ is essentially surjective. The above argument also shows it is fully-faithful, so that $\Fun_\cC(\cM, \cN) \simeq \Mod{A}{B}(\cC)$, which in particular shows $\Fun_\cC(\cM, \cC) \simeq \Mod{}{A}(\cC)$. Now the result follows from Theorem \ref{thm:DelignePrdtOverATCExists}.
%Tensoring a left $A$-module and a right $B$-module gives a canonical $\cC$-balanced bilinear functor 
%\begin{equation*}
%	T: \Mod{A}{}(\cC) \times \Mod{}{B}(\cC) \to \Mod{A}{B}(\cC). 
%\end{equation*}
%To complete the proof we must show this induces an equivalence,
%\begin{equation*}
%	\Mod{}{A}(\cC) \boxtimes_\cC \Mod{B}{}(\cC) \simeq \Mod{B}{A}(\cC).
%\end{equation*}
%When $\cC = \Vect$, this is classical. More generally we must show that the right-hand-side has the desired universal property. For this purpose let $F:\Mod{}{A}(\cC) \times \Mod{B}{}(\cC) \to \cA$ be a $\cC$-balanced bilinear functor. There is a unique right exact linear functor $\overline F: \Mod{B}{A}(\cC) \to \cA$ such that $F = \overline{F} \circ T$ which is defined as follows. On free bimodules $A \otimes X \otimes B \cong T(A \otimes X, B)$, we necessarily have $\overline{F}(A \otimes X \otimes B) \cong F(A \otimes X, B)$. Since $\overline{F}$ is right exact and every $A$-$B$-bimodule is a coequalizer of free $A$-$B$-bimodules, the result follows. 	
\end{proof}

\begin{remark} \label{remark-tensorasfunctors}
If $\cM$ and $\cN$ are right $\cD$-modules, then we have that $\cN \boxtimes_\cD \Fun_{\cD}(\cM,\cD) \simeq \Fun_{\cD}(\cM,\cN)$, and again if $\cM$ and $\cN$ are bimodule categories, then this equivalence is a bimodule equivalence. 
\end{remark}

For rigid tensor categories, it will sometimes be convenient to have an alternative description of $\Fun_C(\cM,\cC)$.

\begin{definition}
Let ${}^*\cM$ denote the $\cD$--$\cC$ bimodule category whose underlying category is $\cM^{\op}$ and the action is given by $d\cdot m \cdot c = {}^*c \otimes m \otimes {}^*d$.  Similarly, let Let $\cM^*$ denote the $\cD$--$\cC$ bimodule category whose underlying category is $\cM^{\op}$ and the action is given by $d\cdot m \cdot c = c^* \otimes m \otimes d^*$.  
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
If ${}_{\cC}\cM_\cD$ is a $\cC$-$\cD$ bimodule category and ${}_{\cC}\cN_\cE$ is a $\cC$-$\cE$ bimodule category, then taking right adjoints gives an equivalence of $\cD$-$\cE$ bimodules $\Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cN)$ and ${}^*\Fun^L_{\cC}(\cN, \cM)$ where $\Fun^L_\cC$ denotes \em{left exact} $\Vect$-enriched module functors.  Similarly, if $\cM$ is a $\cC$-$\cD$ bimodule category and $\cN$ is a $\cD$-$\cE$ bimodule category, then taking right adjoints gives an equivalence of $\cC$-$\cE$ bimodules $\Fun_{D}(\cM, \cN) \rightarrow \Fun^L_{\cC}(\cN, \cM)^*$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We've already seen that the adjoint of a module functor has a canonical module functor structure.  Furthermore, taking adjoints is clearly an equivalence because the right adjoint is quasi-inverse to the left adjoint and vice-versa.  So we need only check that the module structures agree.  First note that taking adjoints interchanges precomposition and postcomposition.  Second, in the former case we have that the right adjoint of left multiplication by $x$ is left multiplication by ${}^*x$, while in the latter case we have that the right adjoint of right multiplication by $x$ is right multiplication by $x^*$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:dual-formula-for-adjoints}
We have that $\cM^* \cong \Fun_{\cD}(\cM, \cD)$ and ${}^*\cM \cong \Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cC)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By the previous lemma, $\Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cC) \cong {}^*\Fun_{\cC}^L(\cC, \cM)$  But the latter is just ${}^*\cM$ since any module functor $\cF$ from $\cC$ to $\cM$ is right multiplication by $\cF(1)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Combining Lemmas \ref{lem:dual-formula-for-adjoints} and \ref{Lma:FunctorsAsATensorPdt} we have that if $\cM$ is a finite $\cD$-$\cC$ bimodule and $\cN$ is a finite $\cC$-$\cE$ bimodule, then $\cM \boxtimes_\cC \cN \cong {}^*(\cM^*) \boxtimes_\cC \cN \cong \Fun_{\cC}(\cM^*,\cN)$ as $\cD$-$\cE$ bimodule categories.   Similarly, $\cM \boxtimes_{\cC} \cN \cong \cM \boxtimes_\cC ({}^*\cN)^* \cong \Fun_{\cC}({}^*\cN,\cM)$ as $\cD$-$\cE$ bimodule categories.  These bimodule category isomoprhisms are the correct version of \cite{???}

\subsection{Exact module categories and adjoints of module functors}
We will now specialize to the theory of finite rigid tensor categories.  The goal of this section is to summarize Etingof and Ostrik's theory of exact module categories.

\begin{definition}
	Let $\cC$ be a finite rigid tensor category. A (left) $\cC$-module category $\cM$ will be called {\em exact} if for any object $M \in \cM$ and  projective object $P \in \cC$, the object $P \otimes M$ is projective in $\cM$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	If $\cC$ is semisimple (e.g. $\cC = \Vect$), then $\cM$ is an exact module category if and only if it is also semisimple.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	$\cC$ is exact considered as a $\cC$-, $\cC^{mp}$-, or $\cC \otimes \cC^{mp}$-module category. 
\end{example}

The following omnibus theorem summarizes the key properties of exact module categories: 
\begin{theorem}[ \cite{???} EGNO] \label{Thm:ExactModCatOmnibus}
	Let $\cC$ be a finite rigid tensor category, and let $\cM$, $\cM'$, $\cM''$ be exact $\cC$-module categories, and $\cN$ an arbitrary $\cC$-module category. Then,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\cM$ has enough projectives \cite[EGNO lemma 2.7.1]{???}
		\item Every projective object in $\cM$  is injective, and vice versa. \cite[EGNO Cor 2.7.4]{???}
		\item $\Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cM')$ is finite \cite[EGNO Prop 2.13.5]{???}; In particular $\cM \simeq \Fun_{\cC}(\cC, \cM)$ is finite.
		\item Composition $\Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cM') \times \Fun_{\cC}(\cM', \cM'') \to \Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cM'')$ is exact in each variable. \cite[EGNO Lemma 2.13.2]{???}		
		\item Every additive (not a priori right exact) module functor $F:\cM \to \cN$ is exact \cite[EGNO 2.7.8]{???}. Hence every functor $F \in \Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cM')$ is exact, and has exact left and right adjoints. Moreover, it follows that   $\Fun_{\cC}(\cM,\cM)$ is again a finite rigid tensor category. 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The following result is well-known, but no proof has appeared in the literature.

\begin{lemma}
	Let $\cC$ be a rigid tensor category. Then every lax (respectively oplax) $\cC$-module functor is strong.  
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We do the oplax case, the lax case is similar.  Suppose that $f_{c,m}:  c \otimes \cF(m) \rightarrow \cF(c \otimes m)$ is a binatural transformation making $\cF$ into an oplax module functor.  The inverse to this natural transformation is given explicitly by the mate of $f_{c^*,m}$ \NS{Is there a terminology convention for right mates versus left mates?}
$$\cF(c \otimes m) \rightarrow c \otimes c^* \otimes \cF(c \otimes m) \rightarrow c \otimes \cF(c^* \otimes c \otimes m) \rightarrow c \otimes \cF(m)$$
where the first map is given by the coevaluation, the second map is $f_{c^*,m}$, and the third map is evaluation.

\NScomm{Insert diagram here}

We need to check that this map is inverse to $f_{c^*,m}$.  This is a straightforward calculation, first use the associativity condition for module functors, and second use naturality to pull an evaluation through the natural transformation.  The following diagram illustrates this calculation.

\NScomm{Insert diagram here}
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma} \label{module-adjoint}
Let $\cC$ and $\cD$ be rigid tensor categories. Let  $\cM$ and  $\cN$  be  $\cC$-$\cD$-bimodule categories and let $\cF: \cM \to \cN$ be a $\cC$-$\cD$-bimdodule functor.  If the underlying functor of $\cF$ has a right (respectively left) adjoint as a functor, then $\cF$ has a right (resp. left) adjoint $\cC$-$\cD$-bimodule functor. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $\cG$ is the right adjoint to the underlying functor of $\cF$, we will show that $\cG$ has a natural structure of a $\cC\boxtimes \cD^{mp}$-module functor.  The result for left adjoints is similar.

The binatural transformation $\psi_{x,n}: x \otimes \cG(n) \rightarrow \cG(x \otimes n)$ is given by the mate
$$x \otimes \cG(n) \rightarrow \cG \cF(x \otimes \cG(n)) \rightarrow \cG(x \otimes \cF\cG(n)) \rightarrow \cG(x \otimes n)$$
where the first map is the unit of the adjunction, the second map is the binatural transformation coming from the module functor structure on $\cF$ and the third map is the counit.  (Note that this mate rotates in the opposite direction from the previous one.

\NScomm{Insert diagram here}

Applying the previous lemma, rigidity of $\cC$ and $\cD$ guarantees that this binatural transformation is an isomorphism.  The compatibility condition is an easy exercise with commuting diagrams.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
If $\cC$ and $\cD$ are not rigid the above argument only shows that the right adjoint to a (lax module functor has only an oplax module functor structure, while the left adjoint of an (oplax) module functor has only a lax module functor structure.  
\end{remark}


\subsection{Multi-fusion categories} \label{sec-tc-fusion}

\CD{CD continues to vote for using 'fusion' rather than 'multifusion'}

%\begin{definition}
%A \emph{fusion category} is a tensor category $\cC$ satisfying the following conditions:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item For all objects $a, b \in \cC$, the vector space $\Hom(a,b)$ is finite dimensional.
%\item The category $\cC$ is semisimple, with finitely many simple objects.
%\item For every object $a \in \cC$, there exists an object $\ld{a} \in \cC$ that is a left dual for $a$ and there exists an object $\rd{a} \in \cC$ that is a right dual for $a$.
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{fusion category} is a tensor category $\cC$ satisfying the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cC$ is finite. %(cf. )
\item $\cC$ is rigid. 
\item $\cC$ is semisimple. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Thus a fusion category has finite dimensional hom vectorspace, has finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects, and every object $a \in \cC$, there exists an object ${a^*} \in \cC$ that is a left dual for $a$ and there exists an object ${}^{*}a \in \cC$ that is a right dual for $a$.


\begin{remark}
Here for brevity we use ``fusion category" to refer to what has elsewhere gone under the name ``multi-fusion category".
\end{remark}

The following result, which is a generalization of Radford's `$S^4$ formula' for Hopf algebras, is an important result in the theory of fusion categories. The proof in \cite[ENO]{???} appeals to the fact that every fusion category is equivalent to the representation category of a weak Hopf algebra.  

\begin{theorem}[\cite{???} ENO]
	A fusion category $\cC$ admits a canonical monoidal equivalence between the identity functor and the quadruple dual functor $\ldddd{(-)}$.
\end{theorem}

\CSP{cite which theorem of ours does this.}
We will give a new proof of this theorem based on the fact that fusion categories are fully dualizable objects in a the symmetric monoidal 3-category of tensor categories (described later in this paper).

\begin{definition}
A fusion category $\cC$ is \emph{pivotal} if it admits a {\em pivotal structure}: a monoidal equivalence between the double right dual functor $\ldd{(-)}: \cC \xra{\ld{(-)}} \cC^{\mop} \xra{\ld{(-)}} \cC$ and identity functor.
\end{definition}

In other words, a fusion category is pivotal if the left dual functor $\ld{(-)}: \cC \ra \cC^{\mop}$ and the right dual functor $\rd{(-)}: \cC \ra \cC^{\mop}$ are monoidally equivalent.


\begin{definition}
	A pivotal structure is {\em spherical} if it induces a monoidal equivalence between the identity functor and the quadruple dual functor which agrees with the canonical equivalence. A fusion category is {\em spherical} if it admits a spherical pivotal structure.  
\end{definition}

\CSP{NS, can you double check this again? I get lost with the calucalations.}
\begin{remark}
	It follows from \cite[Cor. 7.4]{MR2097289} that for fusion categories the above notion of spherical coincides with the usual notion: the left and right traces induced from the pivotal structure agree.
\end{remark}

 

\subsection{Separable Module Categories} \label{sec-tc-separable}

\CSPcomm{[Maybe move this to section 5? It is totally new material, as far as I know.]}

\begin{definition}
	Let $A$ be an algebra object in a finite tensor category $\cC$. The multiplication map $\mu: A \otimes A \to A$ may be viewed as a morphism of $A$-$A$-bimodule objects in $\cC$. We will say that $A$ is {\em separable} if the multiplication map splits as a map of $A$-$A$-bimodules. 
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	A (right exact) monad $T$ acting on a $\cC$-module category $\cM$ is an algebra object in the tensor category $\Fun_\cC(\cM, \cM)$. Thus above definition yields the notion of {\em separable monad}. 
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:SepModCats}
	Let $\cC$ be a finite semisimple tensor category (not necessarily rigid) and let $\cM$ be a finite right $\cC$-module category. Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\cM_\cC \simeq \Mod{}{A}(\cC)$, where $A$ is a separable algebra in $\cC$;
		\item $\cM_\cC \simeq \Mod{}{A}(\cC)$, where $A$ is an algebra in $\cC$ which is projective as an $A$-$A$-bimodule;
		\item The identity functor is a projective object of $\Fun_\cC(\cM, \cM)$;
		\item $\Fun_\cC(\cM, \cM)$ is a semisimple category. 
	\end{enumerate}
	Moreover $\cM$ is semisimple, hence exact as a $\cC$-module category. The analogous results hold for left $\cC$-module categories as well. 
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
	The last sentence is clear since we may switch left/right actions by taking the monoidally-opposite category.
	The proof of Lemma \ref{Lma:FunctorsAsATensorPdt} shows that $\Fun_\cC(\cM, \cM) \simeq \Mod{A}{A}(\cC)$, thus we have clear implications (4) $\Rightarrow$ (3) $\Leftrightarrow$ (2) $\Rightarrow$ (1). We will show that (1) $\Rightarrow$ (4), that is if $A$ is separable, then $\Mod{A}{A}(\cC)$ is a semisimple category. 
	
	To see this, recall the following general fact: if $F: \cA \leftrightarrows \cB: G$ is an adjunction between abelian categories and the right adjoint $G$ is also right exact, then $F$ sends projective objects to projective objects. This is clear as
	\begin{equation*}
		\Hom(F(P), -) \cong \Hom(P, U(-))
	\end{equation*}
	is a right-exact functor. In particular this applies the free-forget adjunction between $A$-$A$-bimodules and objects of $\cC$. As every object of $\cC$ is projective (it is semisimple) we have that every free $A$-$A$-bimodule is also projective in $\Mod{A}{A}(\cC)$. 
	
Let $s: {}_AA_A \to {}_AA \otimes A_A$ be a bimodule splitting of the multiplication map. For every $A$-$A$-bimodule $X$ we have an induced $A$-$A$-bimodule map
\begin{equation*}
	X \cong A \otimes_A X \otimes_A A 
	\xra{s \otimes_A 1 \otimes_A s} (A \otimes A) \otimes_A X \otimes_A (A \otimes A) \cong A \otimes X \otimes A,
\end{equation*}  	
which splits the canonical action map. Thus $X$ is a direct summand of the free bimodule $A \otimes X \otimes A$. As this latter is projective, $X$ is projective. Thus $\Mod{A}{A}(\cC)$ is semisimple, and (1) $\Rightarrow$ (4). 
	
Similarly if $Y \in \cM \simeq \Mod{A}{}(\cC)$ is a left $A$-module, then $s \otimes_A 1: Y \cong A \otimes_A Y \to (A \otimes A) \otimes_A Y \cong A \otimes Y$ realizes $Y$ as a direct summand of a free $A$-module. Again since $\cC$ is semisimple, free $A$-modules are necessarily projective. Thus $Y$ is projective. Hence $\cM$ itself is semisimple.  	
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	If any of the equivalent conditions of Theorem \ref{thm:SepModCats} are satisfied, then we will say that $\cM$ is a {\em separable} module category. If $\cM$ is a $\cC$-$\cD$-bimodule category then we will say $\cM$ is separable if it is separable over both $\cC$ and $\cD$ separately. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	If ${}_\cB\cM_\cC$ and ${}_\cC\cN_\cD$ are separable bimodule categories over semisimple tensor categories, then $\cM \boxtimes_{\cC} \cN$ is a separable $\cB$-$\cD$-bimodule category.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	As separability is a condition on each module structure separately, is is enough to check that $\cM \boxtimes_{\cC} \cN$ is a separable as a $\cB$-module category. 
	
	\CSPcomm{ \begin{itemize}
		\item $\cM = \Mod{}{A}(\cB)$ for a separable algebra $A$.
		\item $\cM = \Mod{B}{}(\cC)$ for a separable algebra $B$, and $\cN = \Mod{}{C}(\cC)$ for a separable algebra $C$. 
		\item $\cM \boxtimes_{\cC} \cN = \Mod{B}{C}(\cC)$, i.e. they are objects of $\Mod{B}{}(\cC)$ which are algebras for the monad $(-) \otimes C$. 
		\item Hence there is a monad $T$ on $\cM$ such that the $T$-algebras in $\cM$ are the same as $\cM \boxtimes_{\cC} \cN$. This monad lives in $\Fun_{\cD}(\cM, \cM)$. 
		\item Thus $T(A)$ is an algebra object in $\cD$, and moreover we have $\cM \boxtimes_{\cC} \cN \simeq \Mod{}{T(A)}$ as right $\cD$-module categories. 
		\item As $A$ and $T$ are separable, we have that $\cM \boxtimes_{\cC} \cN $ is separable.   
	\end{itemize}}
	
	[...]
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	An semisimple tensor category is {\em separable} if it is separable as a $\cC \boxtimes \cC^\mp$-module category.

\section{The symmetric monoidal 3-category of tensor categories} \label{sec-sym-mon}



%In this section we describe the symmetric monoidal 3-category of tensor categories. 
There are several potential theories of symmetric monoidal 3-category which one could select to describe the 3-category of tensor categories. We will employ the theory of iterated complete Segal spaces described by Clark Barwick, \CSP{Get reference. Possible a reference to Simpson's work too?} or more precisely the symmetric monoidal variant thereof. There are two special categories which play a fundamental role in this theory. These are the simplex category $\Delta$ and Segal's category $\Gamma$. We start with a review of $\Gamma$ and its role in describing symmetric monoidal structures. Then we review $\Delta$ and the most basic aspects (mostly definitional) of the theory of symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-categories. Finally we present our construction of the symmetric monoidal $(\infty,3)$-category of tensor categories. 

\begin{warning}
Many important concepts in this section are named after Segal, and the reader should not assume that because two concepts both have ``Segal" in the name that they refer to closely related concepts.  In particular, Segal's category $\Gamma$ and the Segal map will come up in formalizing symmetric monoidal structures, while Segal spaces and Segal squares come up in formalizing $n$-categories.
\end{warning}

\subsection{Symmetric monoidal structures via the category $\Gamma$}

\begin{definition}
	The category  $\Gamma$ has objects finite (unpointed, possibly empty) sets, and a morphism in $\Gamma$ from $A$ to $B$ consists of a function $f: A \to P(B)$, satisfying $f(x) \cap f(y) = \emptyset$ if $x \neq y$, where $P(B)$ denotes the power-set of $B$. 
\end{definition}

This category was introduced by Segal in \cite{Segal-Categories and Cohomology Theories}.  The opposite category $\Gamma^\textrm{op} \simeq Fin_*$ is the category of finite pointed sets. Let $(m) = \{ 1, 2, \dots, m\}$. For each element $a \in A$, there exists a canonical map $i_a: (1) \to A$, which is defined by setting $i_a(1) = \{a\} \subseteq A$. If $C$ is a category with finite products, then the category of commutative monoids in $C$ is equivalent to the category of functors $M:\Gamma^{op} \to C$ such that for all $A\in \Gamma$ the following {\em Segal map} is an isomorphism
\begin{equation*}
	\prod_{a \in A} i_a^*: M(A) \to \prod_{a \in A} M(1).
\end{equation*}
It will be instructive to spell this out explicitly. The case $A=\emptyset$ ensures that $M(\emptyset) = 1$, the terminal object of $C$.  Let $M$ denote $M(1)$, then we have $M(A) \cong M^{\times |A|}$. Maps in $\Gamma$ express ways to combine a $B$-tuple of elements of $M$ into an $A$-tuple of elements in $M$. Explicitly $f: A \to P(B)$
induces a map $f^*: M^{\times |B|} \to M^{\times |A|}$ which sends the $B$-tuple $(m_b)_{b \in B}$ to the $A$-tuple $(n_a)_{a \in A}$ where the element $n_a \in M$ is obtained by multiplying together all the elements $m_b$ where $b$ ranges over the elements in $f(a) \subseteq B$. This is a well-defined operation when $M$ is a commutative monoid, and conversely every such functor arises from a monoid in this manner. 

This generalizes to higher categories as well; the 2-category of symmetric monoidal categories is (weakly) equivalent to the 2-category of {\em strict} functors $\Gamma^{op} \to \Cat$ such that for each $A \in \Gamma$ the Segal maps are equivalences. Naively we expect this to mimic the case for monoids; a monoidal category $(M, \otimes)$ should give rise to a functor $\Gamma^\text{op} \to \Cat$ sending a set $A$ to $M^{\times |A|}$. However we immediately run into difficulty when we try to define functors for each map $f$ in $\Gamma$. Philosophically, we expect $f$ to induce a functor which sends a $B$-tuple of objects of $M$ to an $A$-tuple of objects of $M$ by multiplying together the objects of each $f(a)$-subtuple using the tensor product $\otimes$. However, unless $(M, \otimes)$ is a {\em strict} monoidal category, there is no canonical way to do this. We must choose an ordering and a bracketing of the elements indexed by each $f(a)$. Furthermore, even if we supply such choices, the result is not compatible with composition; we do not obtain a functor in this way. 

This leaves us with two possible avenues of pursuit:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We relax our goal of obtaining a {\em strict} functor. The functors $f^*$ described above are not compatible with composition of maps in $\Gamma$, but they are compatible up to natural isomorphism of functor. In fact there are canonical coherent families of such natural isomorphisms and we obtain a {\em weak} functor from $\Gamma^\text{op}$ to the 2-category $\Cat$. 
	\item We realize that our initial guess that $A \mapsto M^{\times |A|}$ may have been overly optimistic. We content ourselves to have a strict functor $M: \Gamma^\text{op} \to \Cat$ where $M(A)$ is merely {\em equivalent} to  $M^{\times |A|}$. 
\end{enumerate}
Either of these options may be employed, and both give rise to equivalent ways to encode symmetric monoidal structures. The former option is only tenable if we have a tractable theory of weak functors at our disposal. For the case of symmetric monoidal categories we need a weak theory for 2-categories, and indeed there is a well established and usable theory. This option is entirely reasonable in that case. 

However in this paper we ultimately wish to describe a symmetric monoidal 3-category. Option (1) would generally require a robust theory of 4-categories and their weak functors. It is possible to do this using the theory of iterated complete Segal spaces, a model of $(\infty, n)$-categories which we will describe in the next section, but it is just as easy (and perhaps more explicit) to pursue the later option from the start. 

In the case where the monoidal structure in question is defined via a universal property, (which is the case of our primary interest) this second option has a particularly managable solution. Again, it is instructive to consider the 1-categorical case first. To this end we will now describe how the symmetric monoidal category of vector spaces may be encoded as a strict functor from $\Gamma^\text{op}$ to $\Cat$. 

The monoidal structure in $\Vect$ is given by the tensor product of vector spaces, which is defined by a well-known universal property. The tensor product of $V_1$ and $ V_2$ is a universal vector space receiving a bilinear map from $V_1 \times V_2$. In other words, the tensor product $V_{12}$ comes equipped with a bilinear map  $V_1 \times V_2 \to V_{12}$, inducing for all vector spaces $W$ a natural bijection between bilinear maps $V_1 \times V_2 \to W$ and linear maps $V_{12} \to W$. We will say that the bilinear map  $V_1 \times V_2 \to V_{12}$ {\em realizes $V_{12}$ as a tensor product}. As with all universal properties, if the tensor product exists then it is unique up to unique isomorphism, and so it is common practice to write $V_{12} = V_1 \otimes V_2$ for any choice of tensor product.

To define $\otimes$ as an honest functor, though, we must choose a specific representative for each pair $V_1$ and $V_2$. The standard method is to {\em define} the vector space $V_1 \otimes V_2$ as the vector space of linear combinations of formal expressions $v_1 \otimes v_2$ with $v_i \in V_i$, modulo the obvious relations. This operation is not strictly associative (for example the underlying sets of $(V_1 \otimes V_2) \otimes V_3$ and $V_1 \otimes (V_2 \otimes V_3)$ are distinct), but the universal property ensures it is associative up to canonical coherent natural isomorphism.

We will now describe how to encode this symmetric monoidal structure as a strict functor,
\begin{equation*}
	\Vect: \Gamma^\text{op} \to \Cat.
\end{equation*}  
In our initial naive attempt at constructing such a functor we identified the key difficulty: given a $B$-tuple of vector spaces, and a map $f: A \to P(B)$ in $\Gamma$ (i.e. a certain collection of subsets $f(a) \subseteq B$) we need to choose a way to take the tensor product of each of the corresponding subtuples. Rather then make such a choice for each $f$ (which yields only a weak functor $\Gamma^\text{op} \to \Cat$) we will enlarge $\Vect^{\times |B|}$ to include choices of these tensor products for each subset of $B$. 

The most canonical way to do this is to define $\Vect(B)$ to include all possible representatives of the tensor product for each of the subsets of $B$. Thus we obtain the following definition of the category $\Vect(B)$: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The objects consist of a pair of collections, one of vector spaces $\{ V_S \}$ indexed by the subsets $S \subseteq B$, 
	the other of bilinear maps $ \{ v_{S,S'}: V_S \times V_{S'} \to V_{S \cup S'} \} $ 
	indexed by pairs of disjoint subsets $S, S' \subseteq B$. These are required to satisfy the following conditions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $V_{\emptyset} = k$; 
		\item $v_{S,S'}$ realizes $V_{S \cup S'}$ as the tensor product of $V_S$ and $V_{S'}$;
		\item If $S, S', S'' \subseteq B$ are three pairwise disjoint subsets, then the following square of multilinear maps commutes:
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$V_S \times V_{S'} \times V_{S''}$};
		\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$V_{S \cup S'} \times V_{S''}$};
		\node (RT) at (5, 1.5) {$V_S \times V_{S' \cup S''}$};
		\node (RB) at (5, 0) {$V_{S \cup S' \cup S''}$};
		\draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$v_{S,S'} \times id$} (LB);
		\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$id \times v_{S', S''}$} (RT);
		\draw [->] (RT) -- node [right] {$v_{S, S' \cup S''}$} (RB);
		\draw [->] (LB) -- node [below] {$v_{S \cup S', S''}$} (RB);
		%\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
		%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	\end{enumerate} 
	\item The morphisms from $\{ V_S, v_{S, S'} \} \to \{ W_S, w_{S, S'} \}$ consist of collections of linear maps $\{ \phi_S: V_S \to W_S \}$, such that $\phi_{\emptyset} = id$ and for each pair of disjoint subsets $S, S' \subseteq B$ the following square commutes:
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$V_S \times V_{S'}$};
		\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$V_{S \cup S'}$};
		\node (RT) at (4, 1.5) {$W_S \times W_{S'}$};
		\node (RB) at (4, 0) {$ W_{S \cup S'}$};
		\draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$v_{S,S'}$} (LB);
		\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$\phi_S \times \phi_{S'}$} (RT);
		\draw [->] (RT) -- node [right] {$w_{S,S'}$} (RB);
		\draw [->] (LB) -- node [below] {$\phi_{S \cup S'}$} (RB);
		%\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
		%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
	\end{tikzpicture}.
	\end{center}
\end{itemize}
Thus an object of $\Vect(A)$ consist partly of an $A$-tuple of vector spaces, namely $ (V_{\{a\}})_{a \in A}$. Each vector space $V_S$ should then be thought of as a {\em choice} of simultaneous tensor product of all the $V_{\{a\}}$ where $a \in S$. The data and conditions of an object of $\Vect(A)$ make this philosophical viewpoint precise, and similarly for the morphisms of $\Vect(A)$. 

The assignment $A \mapsto \Vect(A)$ gives a functor $\Vect: \Gamma^{op} \to \Cat$, for if $f: A \to P(B)$, then we obtain a functor $f^*: \Vect(B) \to \Vect(A)$ as follows. If $T \subseteq A$, let $f(T) = \cup_{a \in T} f(a) \subseteq B$. Then an object $\{ V_S, v_{S,S'} \}_{S, S' \subseteq B}$ of $\Vect(B)$ is sent via $f^*$ to the object $\{ W_T, w_{T, T'} \}_{T, T' \subseteq A} \in \Vect(A)$, where 
\begin{equation*}
	W_T = V_{f(T)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad  w_{T, T'} = v_{f(T), f(T')}.
\end{equation*}
This is easily seen to be strictly compatible with composition in $\Gamma^\text{op}$. Moreover, since the tensor product is defined by a universal property, the forgetful functor $\Vect(A) \to \Vect^{\times |A|}$ is an equivalence of categories, as desired.  


\subsection{Symmetric monoidal $(\infty,3)$-categories}

\NS{As discussed in email, this subsection should have an expository paragraph near the beginning incorporating some of the motivational material currently in the next section}

In the last section we described how symmetric monoidal structures may be encoded through the use of the category $\Gamma$. In this section will will describe a similar process in which a the composition in a category may be described through the use the combinatorial simplex category $\Delta$. Iterating this idea leads to the notion of {\em $n$-fold Segal category}, and incorporating our insights about $\Gamma$ yields a notion of symmetric monoidal $(\infty,3)$-category.  

\begin{definition}
	The simplex category $\Delta$ is a skeleton of the category of finite non-empty totally ordered sets and order preserving maps. The objects of $\Delta$ are the ordered sets $[n] = \{ 0 < 1 < 2 < \cdots < n\}$. 
\end{definition}

The simplex category plays a dual role which sometimes results in confusing terminology. On the one had it has a geometric interpretation as the category of combinatorial simplices. This gives rise to terminology such as a {\em $k$-simplex} of $[n]$, which is a strictly order preserving map $[k] \to [n]$. There are $ {n+1}\choose {k+1}$ such maps. The $0$-simplices will be called {\em vertices} and $1$-simplices will be called {\em edges}. 

But there are other aspects of $\Delta$ which come from its description as a category of certain totally ordered sets. The vertices of $[n]$ have a natural ordering induced from the ordering of $[n]$. Let $[m + n]$ denote the ordered concatenation of $[m]$ with $[n]$. We thus obtain the following commuting square,
\begin{equation} \label{Eqn:Segal-Co-Map}
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline = 0.75cm]
	\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$[0]$};
	\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$[m]$};
	\node (RT) at (2, 1.5) {$[n]$};
	\node (RB) at (2, 0) {$[m+n]$};
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$m$} (LB);
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$0$} (RT);
	\draw [->] (RT) -- node [right] {$$} (RB);
	\draw [->] (LB) -- node [below] {$$} (RB);
	%\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
	%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}
where $0: [0] \to [n]$ and $m: [0] \to [m]$ denote the first and last vertices, respectively. This square will play an important role in what follows. 

Just as a monoid may be described as a certain presheaf on $\Gamma$, a category may be described as a certain presheaf on $\Delta$, called the {\em nerve} of the category. This well-known construction proceeds as follows: each of ordered sets $[n] \in \Delta$ may be viewed as a category (the objects are the elements of $[n]$, with a unique morphism from $i$ to $j$ is $i \leq j$). Thus if $X$ is a category, we obtain a presheaf $NX$ of sets on $\Delta$ by the assignment $[n] \mapsto NC_n = Fun([n], X)$, the set of functors from $[n]$ to $X$.    
The $n^\textrm{th}$ set of $NX_{\bullet}$ is given by the formula
\begin{equation*}
	NX_n := \sqcup_{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n \in X_0} \hom_X(x_0, x_1) \times \hom_X(x_1, x_2) \times \cdots \times \hom_X(x_{n-1}, x_n).
\end{equation*}
In other words $NC_n$ consists of all length $n$ strings of composable morphisms of $X$.

The nerve construction $N$ is a fully-faithful functor from categories and functors to the category of presheaves. Moreover the essential image of the nerve construction consists of those presheaves $X$ on $\Delta$  such that the squares induced by those in equation (\ref{Eqn:Segal-Co-Map}),
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$X_{m+n}$};
	\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$X_m$};
	\node (RT) at (2, 1.5) {$X_n$};
	\node (RB) at (2, 0) {$X_0$};

	\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
	%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
are a pullback diagrams. 

This can be extended to categories internal to a category $C$. The category of {\em simplicial objects of $C$} is the functor category $Fun(\Delta^\textrm{op}, C) = sC$. We write $X_\bullet$ for such a functor, and let $X_n$ denote the value assigned $[n] \in \Delta$. A {\em category internal to $C$}\footnote{This is easily checked to be equivalent to the standard definition.} is a simplicial object $X$, such that the diagrams induced by those in equation (\ref{Eqn:Segal-Co-Map}),
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$X_{m+n}$};
	\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$X_m$};
	\node (RT) at (2, 1.5) {$X_n$};
	\node (RB) at (2, 0) {$X_0$};
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$$} (LB);
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$$} (RT);
	\draw [->] (RT) -- node [right] {$$} (RB);
	\draw [->] (LB) -- node [below] {$$} (RB);
	\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
	%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
are a pullback diagrams. For a general simplicial object $X$, these commuting squares will be called {\em Segal squares} and if they are pullback squares we will say that $X$ satisfies the {\em Segal condition}. Hence a category internal to $C$ is a simplicial object satisfying the Segal condition. 

This may be contrasted with the notion of a category enriched to $C$, which consists of a {\em set} of objects together with hom objects $\Hom(x,y) \in C$ (as opposed to an object $X_0 \in C$ of objects). Under certain conditions these notions may be related. Recall that a category is {\em extensive} (or {\em infinitary extensive}) if it admits small coproducts and coproducts are disjoint and stable under pullback. If $C$ is an extensive category with a terminal object, then a category enriched in $C$ is merely an internal category $X$ in which the object $X_0$ is {\em discrete}, i.e. a coproduct of terminal objects. Examples of extensive categories with terminal objects include the categories of sets, any category of presheaves (or more generally any Grothendieck topos), the category of topological spaces, and the category of small categories. 

\begin{example}
	An ordinary (small) category is a category enriched in sets.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	A {\em strict 2-category} is a category enriched in categories.
\end{example}

Thus a strict 2-category may equivalently be regarded as a simplical object with values in $\Cat$, such that $X_0$ is a set (thought of as a discrete category), and such the the Segal squares are pullback squares. Since $X_0$ is a set, these pullbacks may be simultaneously regarded as pullbacks in the 1-category of categories and functors or as weak (or homotopy) pullbacks in the 2-category of categories, functors, and natural transformations. If $X_0$ is allowed to be a general category, these two notions of pullback may differ. 

We would now like to use this to insight to describe higher categories. Philosophically an $n$-category is a category enriched in $(n-1)$-categories, and so we should be able to describe it as a presheaf on $\Delta$ with values in the category of $(n-1)$-categories. Moreover this should mimic the nerve. The element $[n] \in Delta$ should be mapped to the $(n-1)$-category of all length $n$ composable strings of $1$-morphisms. 

However, unless our $n$-category is strict this naive attempt will fail to produce a functor out of $\Delta$. The reasons are completely analogous to the previous situation of symmetric monoidal structures. However, the insight gained from the previous section also suggests a possible solution. Rather then require $X_{m+n}$ to be {\em isomorphic} to the pullback $X_m \times_{X_0} X_n$, we require that it merely be {\em equivalent} to the pullback. 
\CSP{Get references/check references for this.}
Following this reasoning gives rise to the notion of weak $n$-category constructed by Simpson and Tamsamani. In what follows we will describe $(\infty,n)$-versions of this construction, where sets are replaced by spaces.  

\begin{definition}
	Let $\sSet$ denote the category of simplicial sets. An {\em $n$-fold simplicial space} is a functor $X: (\Delta^\textrm{op})^{\times n} \to \sSet$. A {\em $\Gamma$-$n$-fold simplicial space} is a functor $X: \Gamma^\textrm{op} \times (\Delta^\textrm{op})^{\times n} \to \sSet$.
\end{definition}

The categories of $n$-fold simplicial spaces and $\Gamma$-$n$-fold simplicial spaces admit combinatorial model structures which give robust theories of $(\infty, n)$-categories and symmetric monoidal $(\infty, n)$-categories, respectively. 
\CSP{Find reference.}
The Hopkins-Lurie proof of the cobordism hypothesis has been proven using this machinery, and so it is natural to  frame our results in this language as well. The fibrant objects of these model categories are the so-called $n$-fold complete Segal spaces and symmetric monoidal $n$-fold complete Segal spaces, respectively (these later are sometimes called special $\Gamma$-$n$-fold complete Segal spaces).
These fibrant objects enjoy many desirable properties. For example, the weak equivalences between fibrant objects are precisely the levelwise weak equivalences. Also many related constructions, like the homotopy category of an $(\infty, n)$-category, have simple direct descriptions for these fibrant objects. 

On the other hand, many examples occurring { in nature} do not arise as $n$-fold complete Segal spaces or as symmetric monoidal $n$-fold complete Segal spaces. For example in \cite{MR2555928}, the $(\infty, n)$-category of cobordisms is constructed as a $n$-fold Segal space which is {\em not} complete. There are a number of classes of $n$-fold simplicial spaces which are intermediary between general $n$-fold simplicial spaces and the fibrant $n$-fold complete Segal spaces. For many purposes these intermediary objects are just as good as their fibrant replacement. One such intermediate notion is that of $n$-fold Segal category, and it is this intermediate notion to which we now turn. 
%\begin{definition}
%	An $n$-fold simplicial space $X$ is {\em essentially constant} if, when regarded as a functor $X: (\Delta^\textrm{op})^{\times n} \to h\textrm{-}(sSet)$, it is equivalent to a constant functor, where $h\textrm{-}(sSet)$ denotes the homotopy category of simplicial sets.  
%\end{definition}
%
We may regard any $n$-fold simplicial space as a simplicial object in $(n-1)$-fold simplicial spaces. A $0$-fold simplicial space is understood to be a simplicial set.

\begin{definition}
	A $0$-fold simplicial space (i.e. a simplicial set) is a {\em $0$-fold Segal category} if it is a Kan complex. An $n$-fold simplicial space $X$, regarded as a simplicial object $X_\bullet$ in $(n-1)$-fold simplicial spaces is an {\em $n$-fold Segal category} if the following conditions are satisfied
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The $(n-1)$-fold simplicial space $X_0$ is constant and discrete.
			\item Each of the $(n-1)$-fold simplicial spaces $X_k$ is an $(n-1)$-fold Segal category.
			\item For every $m, k$, the Segal square,
			\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzpicture}
				\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$X_{m+n}$};
				\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$X_m$};
				\node (RT) at (2, 1.5) {$X_n$};
				\node (RB) at (2, 0) {$X_0$};

			\end{tikzpicture}
			\end{center}
			is a homotopy pull-back square of $(n-1)$-fold simplical spaces, computed with the $(\infty, n-1)$-model structure.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{definition}
This final condition requires some explanation. The Segal square must realize $X_{m+n}$ as the homotopy fiber product $X_m \times_{X_0}^h X_n$, and this homotopy fiber product must be computed in the $(\infty, n-1)$-category model structure on $(n-1)$-fold simplicial sets. Moreover $X_{m+n}$ may not be levelwise equivalent to this homotopy fiber product, but merely weakly equivalent in this model structure. Fortunately, we require that $X_0$ is a discrete $(n-1)$-fold simplcial space. In this case the homotopy fiber product simplifies and is merely the ordinary fiber product. Thus condition (3) is equivalent to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(3')] For every $m$ and $k$ the Segal map $X_{m+n} \to X_m \times_{X_0} X_n$ is an equivalence of $(n-1)$-fold Segal categories. 
\end{enumerate}

Moreover equivalences between $n$-fold Segal categories admit a fairly tractable inductive recognition principle. To describe this me must introduce a few auxiliary concepts. Let $X$ be an $n$-fold Segal category. Recall that $X_0$ is a constant discrete simplicial space, and so may be regarded as a set. We call the elements of $X_0$ objects of $X$. 
Inductively we will define three functorial constructions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For every pair of objects $a,b \in X_0$, an $(n-1)$-fold Segal category $\Hom_X(a,b)$.
	\item A category $\mathit{h}X$, called the {\em homotopy category} of $X$.
	\item A set $\pi_0 X$, which is the set of isomorphism classes of objects of $\mathit{h}X$. 
\end{itemize}
Once we have these constructions, equivalences of $n$-fold Segal categories are easily recognized: they are precisely those maps $f:X \to Y$ of $n$-fold simplicial spaces which induce bijections $\pi_0 f: \pi_0 X \to \pi_0 Y$, 
% equivalences of homotopy categories $\mathit{h}f:\mathit{h}X \to \mathit{h}Y$ 
and which induce equivalences of $(n-1)$-fold Segal categories $\Hom_X(a,b) \to \Hom_Y(fa, fb)$ for every pair of objects $a,b \in X_0$. Such maps also induce equivalences $\mathit{h}f:\mathit{h}X \to \mathit{h}Y$.

Given a pair objects $a,b \in X_0$ in an $n$-fold Segal category $X$, the $(n-1)$-fold Segal category $\Hom_X(a,b)$ is defined to be the fiber over $(a,b) \in X_0 \times X_0$ of the map $(d_0, d_1): X_1 \to X_0 \times X_0$.  
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$\Hom_X(a,b)$};
	\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$pt$};
	\node (RT) at (3, 1.5) {$X_1$};
	\node (RB) at (3, 0) {$X_0\times X_0$};
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$$} (LB);
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$$} (RT);
	\draw [->] (RT) -- node [right] {$$} (RB);
	\draw [->] (LB) -- node [above] {$(a,b)$} (RB);
	\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
	%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The homotopy category $\mathit{h}X$ has the same object set $X_0$, and the morphisms set between two objects is given as the set $\Hom_{\mathit{h}X}(a,b) := \pi_0 \Hom_X(a,b)$. For every triple of objects $a,b,c \in X_0$ we have a similar $(n-1)$-fold Segal category $\Hom_X(a,b,c)$ which is defined as the fiber in $X_2$ over the point $(a,b,c)$ in $X_0 \times X_0 \times X_0$. Since $X$ is an $n$-fold Segal category we have induced maps of $(n-1)$-fold Segal categories,
\begin{equation*}
	\Hom_X(a,b) \times \Hom_X(b,c) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longleftarrow} \Hom_X(a,b,c) \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} \Hom_X(a,c).
\end{equation*}
Composition in $\mathit{h}X$ is given by the induced map of sets,
\begin{equation*}
	 \Hom_{\mathit{h}X}(a,b) \times \Hom_{\mathit{h}X}(b,c) \cong \pi_0 \Hom_X(a,b,c)\to \pi_0 \Hom_X(a,c) = \Hom_{\mathit{h}X}(a,c).
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}
	If we regard a set as a constant simplicial space, then the nerve of a category $NC$ is a 1-fold Segal category. $NC_0 = \textrm{ob}\ C$ and the space $\Hom_{NC}(a,b)$ are the sets $\Hom_C(a,b)$. Moreover $hNC \cong C$ is isomorphic to the category $C$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	A strict 2-category $C$ may be regarded as a simplical object $C_\bullet$ in $\Cat$ whose $n^\textrm{th}$ category is given by the usual formula
	\begin{equation*}
		C_n := \sqcup_{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n \in C_0} \hom_C(x_0, x_1) \times \hom_C(x_1, x_2) \times \cdots \times \hom_C(x_{n-1}, x_n).
	\end{equation*}
	We obtain a 2-fold simplicial set by applying the nerve construction to each of these categories, which, by viewing a set as a discrete simplicial space, we regard as a 2-fold simplcial space $NC_{\bullet \bullet}$. Since $C_\bullet$ satisfies the Segal condition, one deduces that $NC_{\bullet \bullet}$ is a 2-fold Segal category. 
	\footnote{Alternatively, one may start with the simplicial category $C_\bullet$, as before and apply the {\em complete Segal space nerve} to each of the categories $C_n$. The $k^\text{th}$ space of this simplicial space $N^{CSS}_\bullet C_n$ is obtained by first constructing the functor category $Fun([k], C_n)$, then throwing away the non-invertible natural transformations, and finally applying the classifying space functor to the resulting groupoid. This alternative has the advantage that it produces a {\em complete} Segal space $N^{CSS} C_n$. However for our purposes these are equivalent constructions as the canonical map $N C_n \to N^{CSS} C_n$ is a weak equivalence in the complete Segal space model structure. 
	%[Cite the Joyal Teinery paper for the Quillen equivalence between Segal spaces and Quasi-categories]
	} We call the association $C \mapsto NC_{\bullet \bullet}$ the {\em 2-categorical nerve}. 
	\CSP{We should get a reference for this.}
\end{example}

\begin{lemma} \label{lma:2catnervereflectsequiv}
	A strict functor of strict 2-categories $F: C \to D$ is a weak equivalence if and only if the induced map of 2-fold Segal categories $NC_{\bullet \bullet} \to ND_{\bullet \bullet}$ is an equivalence. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The functor $F$ is a weak equivalence if and only if 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item it is essentially surjective on object, and
		\item for every pair of objects $a,b \in C$,  it induces an equivalence of categories $C(a,b) \to D(Fa, Fb)$.
	\end{enumerate}
On the other hand, a map of 2-fold Segal spaces $X \to Y$ is an equivalence if and only if
\begin{enumerate}
	\item it induces a bijection $\pi_0X \to \pi_0Y$, and
	\item for every pair of objects $a,b \in X_0$, it induces equivalences of 1-fold Segal spaces $\Hom_X(a,b) \to \Hom_Y(Fa, Fb)$.
\end{enumerate}
When $X = NC_{\bullet \bullet}$  is a 2-categorical nerve, $\Hom_X(a,b) \cong NC(a,b)_{\bullet}$, so the second conditions are equivalent. Moreover, $\pi_0 NC_{\bullet \bullet}$ is easily seen to be the collection of equivalence classes of objects of $C$. Thus a functor inducing an equivalence of 2-categorical nerves induces a bijection on equivalence classes of objects. In particular if $F$ induces an equivalence of 2-categorical nerves, it is essentially surjective, and hence a weak equivalence of categories. It remains to see that a weak equivalence of categories necessarily induces a bijection on sets of equivalence classes of object. This follows as a well-known exercise.
\end{proof}

%If the $n$-fold Segal spaces $X_k$ are fibrant, that is complete, then these problems disappear. Weak equivalences between fibrant objects are computed levelwise, as are homotopy fiber products. 

%Thus in general we are left with the embarrassing responsibility of computing the correct homotopy fiber product $X_m \times_{X_0}^h X_n$, and showing that the canonical map from $X_{m+n}$ is a weak equivalence of $(\infty, n-1)$-categories. Fortunately there is another subclass of $n$-fold Segal spaces for which these two operations are relatively easy to perform: The {\em $n$-fold Segal categories}.

\begin{definition}
%   A $0$-fold Segal category is a Kan complex. An {\em $n$-fold Segal category} is an $n$-fold Segal space which satisfies
%   \begin{enumerate}
%   	\item $X_0$ is discrete, and
%   	\item for each $n$, $X_n$ is an $(n-1)$-fold Segal category. 
%   \end{enumerate}
	A {\em symmetric monoidal $n$-fold Segal category} (a.k.a. {\em special $\Gamma$-$n$-fold Segal category}) is a $\Gamma$-$n$-fold simplicial space $X$, which we view as a functor from $\Gamma^\textrm{op}$ to $n$-fold simplcial spaces, such that the following conditions are satisfied. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $X_A$ is an $n$-fold Segal category for each $A \in \Gamma$. 
		\item For each set $A \in \Gamma$ (possibly empty) the canonical map,
		\begin{equation*}
			\prod_{a \in A} i_a^*: X_A \to \prod_{a \in A} X_{(1)}
		\end{equation*}
		is an equivalence of $n$-fold Segal categories. %\CSP{Should we also add the $X_{(0)} = pt$? We get $X_{(0)} \simeq pt$ for free.}
	%	\item (optional) The previous axiom implies that $X_\emptyset \simeq pt$. We assert that $X_\emptyset = pt$. 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

In the next section we will construct several examples describing versions of the symmetric monoidal 3-fold Segal category of tensor categories. 

%Thus the goal of this section is to describe $\TC$ as a functor $\Gamma^{\op} \times (\Delta^{\op})^{\times 3} \to \sSet$. This is done in two stages. First we construct a nerve functor from the category of strict 2-categories to 2-fold Segal categories. This reduces the construction of $\TC$ to constructing a functor (also denoted $\TC$) from $\Gamma^{\op} \times \Delta^{\op}$ to the category of strict 2-categories and strict functors. As a warm-up, we first describe a functor $\lincat$ from $\Gamma^{\op}$ to strict 2-categories which serves as a model for the symmetric monoidal 2-category of linear categories. The functor $\TC$ is a more elaborate variation on this construction. 

%We now describe how a strict 2-category gives rise to a 2-fold Segal category. This can be regarded as a 2-categorical nerve. %Later we will construct explicitly $\TC$ as a simplicial object in the category of strict 2-categories. Applying the previous 2-categorical nerve yields a 3-fold simplcial space which is shown to be a 3-fold Segal category. A variation on these constructions yields the $\Gamma$-3-fold Segal space $\TC$. 
%\begin{definition}
%	A strict 2-category is a category object $(C_1 \rightrightarrows C_0)$ in categories such that the category of objects $C_0$ is discrete (i.e. its only morphisms are identities). 
%\end{definition}
%A strict 2-category gives rise to a simplicial category 




\subsection{The symmetric monoidal 3-category of tensor categories} \label{sec-tc-threecat}


We now describe the symmetric monoidal 3-fold Segal category $\TC$. We first construct it as a functor from $(\Gamma \times \Delta)^\textrm{op}$ to strict 2-categories, such that the Segal maps are weak equivalences. We may obtain a $\Gamma$-3-fold simplicial spaces by applying the 2-categorical nerve levelwise. Lemma \ref{lma:2catnervereflectsequiv} implies that the result is indeed a symmetric monoidal 3-fold Segal category. 

Let $A$ be a finite set and $[n]\in \Delta$. The strict 2-category $\TC(A,n)$ should morally be regarded as the 2-category consisting of $A$-tuples of length $n$ strings of composable bimodule categories. In other words, if one had a pre-existing notion of 3-category, then $\TC(A,n)$ should be thought of as functors from the category $A \times [n]$ into the weak 3-category $\TC$. 

As we have seen, the problem with implementing this straightforward idea is that one fails to produce a (strict) functor from $(\Gamma \times \Delta)^\textrm{op}$ to a strict $2$-categories. This is due to the fact that both the symmetric tensor product and the composition of bimodule categories are defined via universal properties and are not strictly associative. Thus $\TC(A,n)$ consists of an enlarged version which includes, in addition to the 
$A$-tuples of length $n$ strings of composable bimodule categories, choices of all the possible composites and tensor products that arise. The most canonical way to do this is to define $\TC(A,n)$ to include all such possible choices. 


%will have objects which consist of collections of several tensor categories, bimodule categories, functors, and natural transformations which are required to satisfy a host of conditions. The 1- and 2-morphisms of $\TC(A,n)$ will be defined similarly. 

% This is largely due to the fact that  composition of bimodule categories is only weakly defined. It is defined up to equivalence of bimdule categories which are in turn defined up to unique natural isomorphism, but this is not sufficient to obtain a {\em strict} functor on $(\Gamma \times \Delta)^\textrm{op}$. One solution is to enlarge $\TC(A,n)$ to include choices of all the possible composites that one would need in order to obtain a strict functor to strict 2-categories. The resulting $\TC(A,n)$ is what we now describe.


 Thus the objects of $\TC(A,n)$ are certain compatible collections of tensor categories, bimodule categories, and their various maps. These collections are parametrized by the $k$-faces of $[n]$ and collections of disjoint subsets of $A$. We summarize the data of an object $X \in \TC(A,n)$ in Tables \ref{Table:ObjectOfTC} and \ref{Table:ObjectOfTC2}.

A 2-morphism between 1-morphisms $F$ and $G$ from $X$ to $Y$ consists of a collection of $\{ \theta_{S;ij} \}$ consisting of $X_{S;i}$-$X_{S;j}$-bimodule natural transformations from $F_{S;ij}$ to $G_{S;ij}$ for each subset $S \subseteq A$ and 2-simplex $ij$ in $[n]$. For completeness we record this in Table \ref{Table:2MorOfTC}.

\end{table}
These are required to satisfy that $\theta_{\emptyset;ij}$ is the identity and the following pair of equations hold:
\begin{list}{(TC2M\arabic{itemcounter})}{\usecounter{itemcounter}}
	\item For each 2-simplex $ijk$, we have
	\begin{equation*}
		(\theta_{S; ik} * 1) \circ \xi^F_{S; ijk} = xi^G_{S;ijk} \circ (1 * (\theta_{S; ij} \times \theta_{S; jk})).
	\end{equation*}
	\item For each pair of disjoint subsets $S, S'$ we have
	\begin{equation*}
		(\theta_{S \cup S'; ij} * 1) \circ \varphi^F_{S, S'; ij} = \varphi^G_{S,S';ij} \circ (1*(\theta_{S;ij} \times \theta_{S';ij})).
	\end{equation*}
\end{list}
With these as objects, 1-morphisms, and 2-morphisms, the obvious composition makes $\TC(A,n)$ into a strict $2$-category. It is manifestly functorial in $A$ and $[n]$ and thus gives a (strict) functor 
\begin{equation*}
	\TC: \Gamma^\textrm{op} \times \Delta^\textrm{op} \to \Cat_2.
\end{equation*}
into the 1-category of strict 2-categories. Composing with the coherent nerve for strict 2-categories gives us a $\Gamma$-3-fold simplicial space, which we also denote $\TC$.

\begin{theorem}
	 $\TC$ is a symmetric monoidal 3-fold Segal category.  
\end{theorem}

\CSP{This maybe needs a little more explanation...}
\begin{proof}
	By Lemma \ref{lma:2catnervereflectsequiv} it is enough to show that the functor to strict 2-categories satisfies the appropriate Segal conditions, i.e. that the following Segal maps are weak equivalences of strict 2-categories:
	\begin{align*}
		\TC(A, m + n) & \to \TC(A, m) \times_{\TC(A, 0)} \TC(A, n), \\
		\TC(A, n) & \to \TC(1, n)^{\times |A|}. 
	\end{align*}
However $\TC$ is constructed in such a way that these Segal maps are manifestly weak equivalences. In each case the difference between the left-hand-side and the right-hand-side consists of choices of representatives of a Deligne tensor product (and maps representing the tensor product). The category of such choices is contractible (by the universal property of the Deligne tensor product) hence these Segal maps are equivalences. 
\end{proof}
 

\CSPcomm{Now maybe set up notion that will be used later in the paper? eg variations on TC, hom categories, etc?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\TCfin$  finite tensor and bimodule categories.
	\item $\TCrig$ rigid finite tensor categories, and finite bimodule categories. 
	\item $\TCss$  finite semisimple tensor categories (i.e. multi-fusion), and finite semisimple bimodule categories. (non-zero global dimension???)
\end{itemize}




\section{Local field theory in dimension three} \label{sec-lft}

\subsection{The cobordism hypothesis}

In this section we review aspects of the cobordism hypothesis which are relevant to the results of this paper. In \cite{Lurie???}     Jacob Lurie gives a expository account of his proof of the cobordism hypothesis, expanding on his joint work with M. Hopkins in dimension two. Portions of this account are quite detailed, while other portions leave a lot to the imagination of the reader. We will explain the precise statement of the cobordism hypothesis in due course, but very roughly it describes a universal property for maps out of the bordism. Lurie's proof proceeds in two steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove the cobordism hypothesis for the symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category of bordisms equipped with {\em framed generalized Morse functions} in the sense of Igusa.
	\item Prove that the forgetful functor from this symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category to the usual symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category of bordisms is an equivalence. To accomplish this he
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Uses Igusa's connectivity result on the connectivity of the space of framed generalized Morse functions to conclude that the forgetful functor is `an $(n+1, n)$-equivalence';
		\item Uses a generalization of the theorem of Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss to conclude that the forgetful functor induces an equivalence in cohomology for every `twisted coefficient system'; and 
		\item Uses obstruction theory for symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-categories to deduce that the forgetful functor is an equivalence. 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
The first step is given a fairly detailed treatment in Lurie's exposition.
The second stage of his proof is an elaborate (and highly original) way to prove the equivalent result that the space of framed generalized Morse functions is contractible for any manifold. Fortunately, the second part of the proof can be entirely circumvented by showing directly that Igusa's space of framed generalized Morse functions is contractible. This has now been done by several authors: [Igusa, unpublished], [Galatius, unpublished], and [Eliashberg-Mishachev] (on the arxiv).

\subsection{Notation for $n$-framed manifolds} 

Since $n$-framed manifolds play a fundamental role in the cobordism hypothesis it will be important to have convenient notation to denote $n$-framed manifolds.  We describe one such notation involving immersions in this section.

Recall that by definition an $n$-framed $k$-manifold $(M,\tau)$ is a k-manifold $M$ equipped with a trivialization $\tau$ of $TM \oplus \RR^{n-k}$.  A convenient way to specify an $n$-framing on a $k$-manifold is to give an immersion $\iota: M \hra \RR^n$ together with a framing $\phi$ of the normal bundle of this immersion.  The framing $\phi$ is by definition an ordered collection of $n-k$ orthonormal sections of the normal bundle $\nu(\iota)$; this framing can equivalently be viewed as a trivialization $\phi: \nu(\iota) \simeq \RR^{n-k}$ of the normal bundle.  The normally framed immersion $(\iota, \phi)$ provides an $n$-framing on $M$ by the composite
\[TM \oplus \RR^{n-k} \simeq TM \oplus \nu(\iota) \simeq  \RR^n.\]
Here the first isomorphism is provided by the inverse of the normal framing $\phi$, and the second isomorphism is given by the standard (``blackboard") identification of the sum of the tangent bundle and the normal bundle with the trivial bundle.

When drawing $n$-framed manifolds using the normally framed notation described above, we draw the immersed manifold and draw the normal framing, and leave the induced $n$-framing completely implicit.  When the immersion is codimension-1, the normal framing may be indicated simply by a unidirectional gray corona coming off the manifold.  Moreover, because in the codimension-1 case this corona can propogate without ambiguity, it may be indicated only at one point of the manifold.

\begin{example}
A $2$-framing on an oriented circle induces a $2$-framing on each point on that circle (by using the orientation to identify the tangent bundle with $\RR$).  Furthermore, for one of the orientations on a given circle the $2$-framing induced on each point is positive, while for the other it's negative.  Thus $2$-framings of a given circle can be naturally identified with maps from that circle with the positive orientation to the space of positively oriented points.   Since the space of framed points is canonically oriented, $2$-framings on a circle can be naturally identified with $\mathbb{Z}$ via the winding number.  We use our immersion notation to depict, as follows, a series of circles corresponding to each element of $\mathbb{Z}$:\NS{I think this is stated rigorously now, but I think the diagrams currently are $3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3$} \CD{CD will consider this example again, regarding the identification with $\ZZ$ and the sign.}

\begin{warning}  \NS{What about in nonzero codimension?  Is there a theorem saying those always come from immersions?}
Not every $n$-framed $n$-manifold can be specified in this way. For example the circle has no immersion into $\RR^1$ but does have a (unique) $1$-framing.
\end{warning}

For $m < n$, an $m$-framed $k$-manifold $(M,\tau)$ is naturally $n$-framed by the trivialization $\tau \oplus \gamma$ where $\gamma$ is the canonical trivialization of $\RR^{n-m}$.  Similarly, given a normally framed immersion $(\iota: M \hra \RR^m, \phi: \nu(\iota) \simeq \RR^{m-k})$, there is a naturally associated normally framed immersion $(M \hra \RR^m \ra \RR^n, \phi \oplus \id_{\RR^{n-m}})$.  This stabilization of a normally framed immersion is clearly compatible with the stabilization of the associated $m$-framed manifold.

\begin{example}
The unique $1$-framing on the circle induces a $2$-framing on the circle; that $2$-framing agrees with the $2$-framing induced by the figure 8 immersion above. 
\end{example}

The association of an $n$-framed manifold to a normally framed immersion works just as well for manifolds with boundary or manifolds with corners.  Moreover, when these manifolds are bordisms, we can fix conventions for how a normal framing (therefore $n$-framing) of the bulk induces a normal framing (therefore $n$-framing) of the boundary.  Given a bordism $M$ without corners, each boundary component of $M$ is labelled either ``in" or ``out", according to whether it is part of the source or target of the bordism.  Now suppose $M$ is equipped with a normally framed immersion $(\iota,\phi)$.  An incoming boundary component $N \subset (\partial M)_{\textrm{in}}$ inherits the structure of a normally framed immersion: the immersion is the restriction of the immersion of $M$, and the framing is $(j, s) \subset \nu(N,\RR^n)$, where $j$ is a section of the normal bundle of $N$ pointing into the bulk manifold $M$, and $s \subset \nu(M,\RR^n)$ is the given normal frame of $M$.  Given a higher bordism, that is a manifold $M$ with corners representing a morphism in $\Bord_0^n$, that is equipped with a normally framed immersion, the incoming and outgoing boundaries (which are now codimension zero submanifolds of the boundary of $M$) inherit normal framings exactly as for the boundaries of ordinary bordisms.  Furthermore, the boundaries of these boundaries inherit normal framings by the same procedure.  Iterating this procedure for inducing normal framings on the boundaries provides consistently defined normal framings to every corner of the original bordism $M$.

In drawing manifolds with boundary and corners, we also need to specify which parts of the boundary are incoming and outgoing.  Outgoing pieces of the boundary will be indicated by a small arrow pointing out of the bulk of the manifold; incoming pieces of the boundary will be undecorated---implicitly the arrows would point into the bulk.  When the immersion is codimension zero, the outgoing boundary arrows may be replaced by a gray corona, which serves to directly record the induced normal framing of those parts of the boundary.  At corners, a combination of these indications will be used.  For instance, an arrow together with a corona on a codimension 2 corner indicates respectively the first and second vectors of the induced framing on the corner.

\begin{warning}
If $M$ is an $n$-manifold with boundary immersed in $\RR^n$ the corona indicates which boundaries are outgoing, while if $M$ is an $n-1$ manifold with boundary immersed in $\RR^n$ the corona indicates the trivialization of the normal bundle.  These two usages are compatible: the induced trivialization of the normal bundle of the outgoing boundary is indeed the outward trivialization, therefore indicated by an outward corona.  By constrast, the trivialization of the normal bundle of an incoming boundary is the inward trivialization, therefore would be indicated by a corona pointing into the bulk manifold; this type of corona is covered by the bulk and therefore cannot be seen.
\end{warning}

The right point is incoming, and the left point is outgoing.  Both boundary points inherit framings isomorphic to the second picture in example~\ref{eg-framenot0}.  Here is a picture of a $2$-framed manifold:

Both boundary points are incoming, and the induced framing on these points are, left to right, respectively the last two points pictured in example~\ref{eg-framenot0}.  Note that corona in this example specifies the trivialization of the normal bundle.

Here is a picture of a $2$-framed manifold:
\[

Note that here the corona denotes that the boundary is outgoing.  This boundary is the circle with the outward trivialization of its normal bundle.  The two uses of the corona are therefore consistent.

The source and target of this bordism are as indicated.  Notice that the source of the source (a pair of $2$-framed points) is indeed the source of the target, and similarly the target of the source is the target of the target.

\subsection{Structure groups of 3-manifolds} \label{sec-lft-struc}

The second half of the cobordism hypothesis says that TFTs with other topological structures correspond to homotopy fixed points of certain group actions on the space of fully dualizable objects.  Thus different topological structures correspond to different kinds of structures on dualizable tensor categories.  In this section we discuss several specific topological structures which will come up later in the paper.

\begin{definition}
An \emph{structure} for $n$-dimensional vector bundles is a space $T$ together with a fibration $f: T \ra BO(n)$.  A $T$-structure on an n-dimensional vector bundle $V$ on $X$ is a lift of the classifying map $X \xra{V} BO(n)$ along $f$ to $T$.
\end{definition}

We will be primarily interested in five structures for 3-dimensional vector bundles, namely \emph{orientation}, \emph{combing}, \emph{oriented $p_1$ structure}, \emph{quadratic structure}, and \emph{framing}.  The structure spaces for an orientation, combing, and framing are respectively $BSO(3)$, $BSO(2)$, and $BSO(1) = *$, all with the obvious maps to $BO(3)$.  The structure spaces for oriented $p_1$ structure and quadratic structure are as follows:
\begin{definition}
The following two spaces, together with the obvious maps to $BO(3)$, define the aforementioned bundle structures:
\begin{itemize}
\item[Orpo:] $BOrpo(3) := \hofib(BSO(3) \ra BSO \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4))$
\item[Quad:] $BQuad := \hofib(BSO(2) = BU(1) \xra{c_1^2} K(\ZZ,4))$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
``Orpo structure" is short for ``oriented $p_1$ structure", and sometimes goes under the name ``$p_1$ structure" in the literature.  We reserve the name ``$p_1$ structure" for the structure group where only $p_1$ has been killed, rather than $w_1$ and $p_1$.  The terminology ``quadratic" refers to the fact that the single k-invariant of the structure space $BQuad$ is the fundamental quadratic map.
\end{remark}

Because we are concentrating on structures on manifolds of low dimension, the full homotopy type of the structure spaces is not relevant---it suffices to keep track only of the low-dimensional homotopical information of $BO(3)$ and the other structure spaces.  Recall that the $k$-homotopy type (or simply the ``$k$-type") of a space $X$ refers to the homotopical information contained in the $k$-Postnikov section $P_k X$ of the space; the $k$-Postnikov section $P_k X$ is the initial space in the category of spaces $Y$ equipped with a map $X \ra Y$ inducing an isomorphism on $\pi_i$ for $i \leq k$ and such that $\pi_i(Y) = 0$ for $i > k$.  \CD{Prefer to define $P_k X$ otherwise?} Said directly, the $k$-Postnikov section is the space you get by killing all the homotopy groups above dimension $k$.

The following proposition explains how much of the homotopy type of the structure space you need to keep track of in order to recover the homotopy type of the space of structured field theories:
\begin{proposition}
Suppose $S \ra BO(n)$ and $T \ra BO(n)$ are $n$-dimensional structures, and $p: S \ra T$ is a map of structures, that is a map over $BO(n)$.  Let $\cC$ be a symmetric monoidal $n$-category.  The map of structures induces a map of bordism categories $\phi: \mathrm{SBord}_0^n \ra \mathrm{TBord}_0^n$, which in turn induces a map $\phi^*$ between the spaces of $\cC$-valued field theories.  If the structure map $p: S \ra T$ is an isomorphism on $\pi_i$ for $i \leq n$ and is surjective on $\pi_{n+1}$, then the induced map $\phi^*: \Hom(\mathrm{TBord}_0^n,\cC) \ra \Hom(\mathrm{SBord}_0^n,\cC)$ is a homotopy equivalence of spaces.
\end{proposition}

\nid We leave the proof to the reader.  Note that this proposition certainly fails to be true if the discrete symmetric monoidal $n$-category $\cC$ is replaced by a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category with nontrivial homotopy in its spaces of $n$-morphisms.  As we are concentrating on 3-dimensional bordism categories and using the discrete 3-category $\TC$ as our target, it suffices to understand the 4-types of our various structure spaces.

We now precisely identify the 4-homotopy type of the four nontrivial structure spaces under consideration.  The framing structure space is of course contractible.  The homotopy type of the combing structure space is simply $K(\ZZ,2)$, so in particular that is also its 4-type.

\begin{proposition}
The following fibrations consistute the Postnikov towers of the 4-homotopy types of the structure spaces $BSO(3)$, $BOrpo(3)$, and $BQuad$.
\begin{align}
K(\ZZ,4) \ra & \; BSO(3)_4 \ra K(\ZZ/2,2) \overset{\gamma}{\dashrightarrow} K(\ZZ,5) \nn \\
K(\ZZ/4,3) \ra & \; BOrpo(3)_4 \ra K(\ZZ/2,2) \overset{\delta}{\dashrightarrow} K(\ZZ/4,4) \nn \\
K(\ZZ,3) \ra & \; BQuad_4 \ra K(\ZZ,2) \overset{c_1^2}{\dashrightarrow} K(\ZZ,4) \nn
\end{align}
\nid Here the dashed arrow indicates the k-invariant of the preceding fibration.  The class $\delta \in H^4(K(\ZZ/2,2);\ZZ/4)$ is a generator, and the class $\gamma \in H^5(K(\ZZ/2,2);\ZZ) = \ZZ/4$ is, up to sign, the integral Bockstein of $\delta$. % The sign is not well defined, because you can always modify \gamma by an automorphism of K(Z,5); ie this is the best you can do.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The quadratic structure group is defined as the homotopy fiber of the square of the first chern class, so in that case there is nothing to prove.

The first four homotopy groups of $BSO(3)$ are $\pi_1 = 0$, $\pi_2 = \ZZ/2$, $\pi_3 = 0$, $\pi_4 = \ZZ$.  The Postnikov tower of the 4-type of $BSO(3)$ is therefore as indicated for some k-invariant in $H^5(K(\ZZ/2,2);\ZZ) = \ZZ/4$.  This k-invariant isn't trivial: the cohomology group $H^5(K(\ZZ/2,2) \times K(\ZZ,4);\ZZ)$ has 4-torsion elements, while the group $H^5(BSO(3);\ZZ)$ does not.  Similarly, the k-invariant isn't twice a generator of $H^5(K(\ZZ/2,2);\ZZ)$: the group $H^4(K(\ZZ/2,2) \ltimes_{2\gamma} K(\ZZ,4);\ZZ/2)$ is rank two, while $H^4(BSO(3);\ZZ/2)$ is rank one.  The k-invariant for the 4-type of $BSO(3)$ is therefore a generator, as claimed. \CD{Is that semidirect product symbol facing the right direction?}

The structure space $BOrpo(3)$ is defined as the homotopy fiber of the composite $BSO(3) \ra BSO \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4)$; as before we refer to this composite simply as $p_1$.  In the appendix, it is shown that this map $p_1: BSO(3) \ra K(\ZZ,4)$ is a generator of $H^4(BSO(3);\ZZ)$, and, somewhat non-obviously, that it induces multiplication by \emph{four} in homotopy.  The first four homotopy groups of $BOrpo(3)$ are therefore $\pi_1 = 0$, $\pi_2 = \ZZ/2$, $\pi_3 = \ZZ/4$, $\pi_4 = 0$.  The Postnikov tower of the 4-type of $BOrpo(3)$ is therefore as indicated for some k-invariant in $H^4(K(\ZZ/2,2);\ZZ/4) = \ZZ/4$.  The Postnikov tower of a space is functorial, so the existence of a map $BOrpo(3) \ra BSO(3)$ inducing an isomorphism on $\pi_2$ forces the k-invariant of $BOrpo(3)$ to be a generator $\delta \in H^4(K(\ZZ/2,2);\ZZ/4)$, and in fact shows that $\pm \beta_{\ZZ} \delta = \gamma$. \CD{Probably that proof could be improved, it's just the first thing that came to mind as I was typing.}
\end{proof}

We have the following diagram of structure spaces:

Here we have indicated in the subscripts and superscripts the stages of the respective Postnikov towers of the homotopy 4-types.  The two horizontal maps exist by definition, and the righthand vertical map is the standard inclusion.  The lefthand vertical map may be constructed as follows.  At the first layer of the Postnikov tower, the map $\pi: K(\ZZ,2) \ra K(\ZZ/2,2)$ is induced by the projection $\ZZ \ra \ZZ/2$.  To produce a map $BQuad \ra BOrpo(3)$ it suffices to factor the composite $K(\ZZ,2) \xra{\pi} K(\ZZ/2,2) \xra{\delta} K(\ZZ/4,4)$ through the map $K(\ZZ,2) \xra{c_1^2} K(\ZZ,4)$; this is accomplished by (plus or minus) the projection $K(\ZZ,4) \ra K(\ZZ/4,4)$.  %%% {This is because the path loop construction is functorial so any map K(\ZZ,4) \ra K(\ZZ/4,4) induces a map of fibrations, which pulls back across c_1^2, resp \delta, to give a map of fibrations whose total spaces are BQuad and BOrpo(3) respectively.  To check the factorization, just look at the induced maps in cohomology.

By construction, the four maps of structure spaces above induce the `obvious' maps on homotopy, namely $\pi_2(BQuad \ra BSO(2))$ is an isomorphism, $\pi_2(BQuad \ra BOrpo(3))$ and $\pi_3(BQuad \ra BOrpo(3))$ are both surjective, $\pi_2(BSO(2) \ra BSO(3))$ is surjective, and $\pi_2(BOrpo(3) \ra BSO(3))$ is an isomorphism.  

\section{Dualizability and tensor categories} \label{sec-dualfusion}

In this section we prove the main theorem, that multi-fusion categories of non-zero global dimension are fully dualizable.  We explicitly work out the dualizing data, thereby getting explicit formulas for certain bordisms in the (unique up to equivalence) associated TFT.  Many of these duals do not require the full strength of the assumption.  In particular, considerably weaker assumptions (relaxing semisimplicity, non-zero global dimension, and even part of rigidity) suffice to construct a fully local categorified $2$-dimensional TFT.

\subsection{Duals of objects and invariants of elementary 1-framed bordisms} \label{sec-df-objects}

In this section we show that $\cC^\mp$ is the dual of $\cC$. 

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:objduals}
The bimodule categories ${}_\mathrm{\Vec} \cC_{\cC^\mp \boxtimes \cC}$ and ${}_{\cC^\mp \boxtimes \cC} \cC_{\Vec}$ (each with the obvious actions) give the coevaluation and evaluation of a duality.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We need to check that the tensor product ${}_\cC (\cC \boxtimes \cC) \boxtimes_{\cC \boxtimes \cC^{\mp} \boxtimes \cC} (\cC \boxtimes \cC)_\cC$ is trivial as a $\cC$--$\cC$ bimodule.  This tensor product is universal for $\cC \boxtimes \cC^{\mp} \boxtimes \cC$-balanced functors out of $\cC \boxtimes \cC \boxtimes \cC \boxtimes \cC$ where the right action of $(a,b,c)$ on $(x,y,z,w)$ is given by $(xa,byc,z,w)$ and the left action is given by $(x,y,azb,cw)$.  Switching the middle two factors, we see that this tensor product is universal for $\cC \boxtimes \cC \boxtimes \cC$-balanced functors out of $\cC \boxtimes \cC \boxtimes \cC \boxtimes \cC$ where the right action of $(a,b,c)$ on $(x,y,z,w)$ is given by $(xa,y, bxc, w)$ and the left action is given by $(x, ayb, z,cw)$.  But this is just the universal property of $\cC \boxtimes_\cC \cC \boxtimes_\cC \cC \boxtimes_\cC \cC$ which is naturally identified with $\cC$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	$\TCfin$ is fully $1$-dualizable. 
\end{proposition}

%%%

By the cobordism hypothesis, the previous theorem shows that there is a $1$-dimensional TFT attached to every finite tensor category, and that this TFT is unique up to equivalence.  Note that this TFT is ``twice categorified" in the sense that it's a functor of $(3,1)$-categories, not $1$-categories.  For example, this gives an action of the mapping class group on the invariant attached to a circle.  The reader should always remember that the TFT associated to $\cC$ is only well-defined up to equivalence, nonetheless we will pick a nice representative and often call that ``the TFT assigned to $\cC$."

Explicitly the 1-framed field theory $F_\cC$ associated to the finite tensor category $\cC$ takes the following values on the elementary 0- and 1-bordisms:

\nid The gray fuzz on the points here indicates the normal orientation of their immersions in $\RR^1$, and therefore specifies their 1-framing.  The small arrows indicate which boundary components are incoming (when there are no arrows, therefore arrows implicitly pointing into the bulk manifold) and which are outgoing (when there are arrows pointing out of the bulk manifold).  Note that the circle here is not depicted as an immersed normally-framed manifold, but directly as a framed manifold; indeed this depicts the unique 1-framing on the circle.  As indicated, the invariant of this circle is $\cC \btimes_{\cC \btimes \cC^\mp} \cC$, where both actions are the naive ones; we will denote this cyclic self-tensor product by $\cT(\cC)$.

\begin{warning}
Contrary to what you might expect,  if $\cC$ is not pivotal $\cT(\cC)$ need not be equivalent to the Drinfel'd center $Z(\cC)$.  Indeed $\cT(\cC)$ need not even be a tensor category.  This is because there is no $2$-framed pair of pants whose boundary circles all have the $2$-framing induced from the unique $1$-framing on the circle.  This will be explained in more detail when we discuss the $2$-dimensional $2$-framed theory.
\end{warning}

\begin{remark}
Since this is a twice categorified TFT, there is more data involved in describing it fully than what we have given above.  For example, we could ask for explicit formulas for the cusp generator or for the mapping class group action on the invariant of a circle.  In this case, there is nothing interesting in this additional data.  This is because the image of the bordism $(3,1)$-category lands in a subcategory of $\TCfin$ which is equivalent to an ordinary $1$-category.  In particular, the image of the cusp generator can be taken to be the explicit functor constructed via universal properties in Theorem \ref{thm:objduals}, and the mapping class group action on the circle is trivial.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Adjoints of bimodules: finite tensor categories are fully 2-dualizable}  \label{sec-df-modules}

In this section we give sufficient conditions for a  bimodule category ${}_\cC \cM_\cD$ to have left and right adjoints.  In particular, if $\cC$ and $\cD$ are finite tensor categories, and their action on $\cM$ is right exact (which we have been assuming throughout), then $\cM$ has both a left and a right adjoint.  Explicitly, the right adjoint of $\cM$ is the category of right exact left module functors 
$\Fun_{{\cC}}(\cM, \cC)$
 where the left $\cD$ action is given by precomposition by right multiplication, and the right $\cC$ action is given by postcomposition by right multiplication.  Similarly, the left adjoint is given by the category of right exact right module functors $\Fun_{\cD}(\cM, \cD)$.  The key assumptions in this section are finiteness of the categories and right exactness of the module actions.

Recall from the background section that $\Fun_{{\cC}}(\cM, \cC)$ is equivalent as a bimodule category to ${}^*\cM$ (which is $\cM^{\op}$ with the bimodule actions twisted by ${}^*\cdot$), while $\Fun_{\cD}(\cM, \cD)$ is equivalent as a bimodule category to $\cM^*$.

\begin{lemma}
The map $\ev_R: \Fun_{{\cD}}(\cM, \cD) \boxtimes_{\cC} \cM \rightarrow \cD$ induced by the $\cC$-balanced bifunctor $(f,m) \mapsto f(m)$ has a natural $\cD$--$\cD$ bimodule structure given by $f(m d_1) d_2 \mapsto f(m) d_1 d_2$ via the right $\cD$-module structure on $f$.  Similarly, $\ev_L: \cM \boxtimes_{\cD} \Fun_{\cC}(\cM, \cC) \rightarrow \cC$ is naturally a map of $\cC$--$\cC$ bimodule categories.
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof}
Straightforward. \CD{At some point we should replace or remove the non-proofs.}
\end{proof}

The maps $\ev_R$ and $\ev_L$ give the counits of the adjunctions $\cM \dashv \Fun_{{\cD}}(\cM, \cD)$ and $\Fun_{\cC}(\cM,\cC) \dashv \cM$ respectively.  The units of the adjunctions are more delicate, since it is more difficult to describe maps into a tensor product than maps out of a tensor product. Fortunately Lemma \ref{Lma:FunctorsAsATensorPdt} provides an alternate description of the tensor product as a category of functors, making it straightforward  to describe the units.

%\begin{lemma}
%If ${}_\cC\cM_\cD$ and ${}_\cC \cN_\cE$ are finite bimodule categories where the bimodule actions are right exact, then the map $\Fun_{\cC}(\cM,\cC) \boxtimes_\cC \cN \rightarrow \Fun_{\cC}(\cM,\cN)$ induced by $(f,n) \mapsto (m \mapsto f(m)n)$ is an equivalence of $\cD$--$\cE$ bimodules.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%\CSPcomm{This is now  move that here?}
%\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
The map $\coev_L: \cD \rightarrow \Fun_{\cC}(\cM,\cM) \cong \Fun_{\cC}(\cM,\cC) \boxtimes_\cC \cM$ sending $d$ to right multiplication by $d$ is a map of $\cD$-$\cD$ bimodules.  Similarly, the map $\coev_R: \cC \rightarrow \Fun_{\cD}(\cM,\cM) \cong \Fun_{\cD}(\cM,\cD) \boxtimes_\cD \cM$ sending $c$ to left multiplication by $c$ is a map of $\cC$-$\cC$ bimodules.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm-evcoev}
The pairs $(\ev_R$, $\coev_R)$ and $(\ev_L, \coev_L)$ each provide the unit and counit of an adjunction.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The following diagram commutes.
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzpicture}[align=left]	
				\node (A) at (0in,2in) {${}_\cC \cM_\cD$};
				\node (B) at (0in,1.5in) {${}_\cC \cM \boxtimes_\cD \cD_\cD$};
				\node (C) at (0in,1in) {${}_\cC \cM \boxtimes_\cD \Fun_{\cC\text{-mod}}(\cM,\cC) \boxtimes_\cC \cM_\cD$};
				\node (D) at (2.5in,1in) {${}_\cC \cM \boxtimes_D \Fun_{\cC\text{-mod}}(\cM,\cM)_\cD$};
				\node (E) at (0in, .5in) {${}_\cC \cC \boxtimes_\cC \cM_\cD$};
				\node (F) at (0in,0in) {${}_\cC \cM_\cD$};
				\draw [<->] (A) to node [left=.1cm] {} (B);
				\draw [->] (B) to node [left=.1cm] {$\id \boxtimes \coev_L$}  (C);
				\draw [->] (B) to [bend left] node [above=.1cm]{$\id \boxtimes (d \mapsto \bullet \otimes d)$} (D);
				\draw [<->] (C) to node {} (D);
				\draw [->] (C) to node [left=.1cm]{$\ev_L \boxtimes \id$} (E);
				\draw [<->] (E) to node {} (F);
				\draw [->] (D) to [bend left] node [right=.1cm]{$m \boxtimes \cF \mapsto \cF(m)$} (F);
			\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{center}

Thus instead of computing along the left side of the diagram, we can compute along the right side of the diagram to see that the composition ${}_\cC \cM_\cD \rightarrow {}_\cC \cM_\cD$ is given by right multiplication by $1 \in \cD$, and hence is the identity.
The other three calculations are similar.
\end{proof}

Thus we have proven
\begin{theorem}
	$\TCfin$ is fully 2-dualizable. 
\end{theorem}

\NScomm{We should modify the above to reflect the fact that we only need exactness of tensor product, not rigidity}

\subsection{Invariants of elementary 2-framed bordisms}

By the cobordism hypothesis, the previous theorem shows that there is a $2$-dimensional $2$-framed TFT attached to every finite tensor category with exact tensor product, and that this TFT is unique up to equivalence.  Note that this TFT is ``categorified" in the sense that it's a functor of $(3,2)$-categories, not $2$-categories.  For example, this gives an actions of the mapping class groups on the invariants attached to surfaces.  

We now illustrate the behavior of this field theory by describing its value on various simple 2-framed bordisms.  As always, this TFT is only well-defined up to equivalence, we pick a particularly nice representative.

Table~\ref{table-points} lists four standard 2-framed 0-manifolds along with their associated invariants.

Notice that the first and fourth (and similarly the second and third) are equivalent, but not canonically equivalent, framed manifolds; their invariants are thus also equivalent, but not canonically so.  Of course, one could write down an equivalent TFT where all positive points are sent to $\cC$ and all negative points are sent to $\cC^{\mp}$, but this would break certain symmetries (in particular, you need to choose which way to identify the second and third points above, and there are two such natural choices).

A generating collection of 2-framed 1-manifolds have invariants as listed in Table~\ref{table-intervals}.

\caption{Invariants associated to 2-framed intervals.} \label{table-intervals}
\end{table}
Throughout that table, the actions not specifically described are the naive actions.  In the first four cases, the indicated map is a tensor functor to $\cC^\mp$, therefore specifies a left action of $\cC^\op$ on $\cC$ via the natural left action of $\cC^\mp$ on $\cC$, which is to say the natural right action of $\cC$ on $\cC$.  In next set of four cases, the indicated map specifies the left action.  

\begin{remark} \label{remark-altintervals}
Though the invariants listed in Table~\ref{table-intervals} represent the most natural choices, it is possible to modify these invariants up to equivalence into less natural and less symmetrical, but sometimes more computationally convenient, forms.  For example, we may associate the invariant $\cC^\mp$ to the point
\cb{
\begin{tikzpicture}
\filldraw (0,0) circle (\pointrad);
\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}
\draw[->,outstyle] (0,0) -- +(0:\arrowlength) node[anchor=north west,inner sep=1pt] {\tiny 1};
\draw[->,outstyle] (0,0) -- +(-90:\arrowlength) node[anchor=north west,inner sep=1pt] {\tiny 2};
\end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}
}
rather than $\cC^\op$ as we did before.  Given that choice, we may associate the bimodule ${}_\Vec \cC_{\cC \btimes \cC^\mp}$, with the naive action, to the bordism
\cb{
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[linestyle,fuzzright] (0,0) arc (90:270:\smcirclerad);
\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}
	\draw[->,outstyle] (0,0) -- +(0:\arrowlength);
	\draw[->,outstyle] (0,-2*\smcirclerad) -- +(0:\arrowlength);
\end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}
}.
At the same time we associate the invariant ${}_{\cC^\mp \btimes \cC} \cC_{\Vec}$, again with the naive action, to the bordism
\cb{
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[linestyle,fuzzleft] (0,0) arc (-90:90:\smcirclerad);
\end{tikzpicture}
}.
Given these choices, the bordism
\cb{
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[linestyle,fuzzright] (0,0) arc (-90:90:\smcirclerad);
\end{tikzpicture}
}
is forced to have as invariant the bimodule ${}_{\cC \btimes \cC^\mp} \cC_\Vec$, where the action of $\cC^\mp$ is the naive action precomposed with the tensor functor $\cC^\mp \xra{(-)^{**}} \cC^\mp$.  That bimodule is equivalent to the bimodule $\Fun_{\cC \btimes \cC^\mp}(\cC,\cC \btimes \cC^\mp)$ with the naive actions.  Similarly the bordism
\cb{
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[linestyle,fuzzleft] (0,0) arc (90:270:\smcirclerad);
\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}
	\draw[->,outstyle] (0,0) -- +(0:\arrowlength);
	\draw[->,outstyle] (0,-2*\smcirclerad) -- +(0:\arrowlength);
\end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}
}
is forced to have as invariant the bimodule ${}_{\Vec} \cC_{\cC^\mp \btimes \cC}$, where the action of $\cC^\mp$ is the naive action precomposed with again the tensor functor $\cC^\mp \xra{(-)^{**}} \cC^\mp$.  That bimodule is equivalent to the bimodule $\Fun_{\Vec}(\cC,\Vec)$ with the naive actions.

\CD{Add remark about the invariants of the circles in the non-rigid case.}
The middle and right columns present two different, equivalent, formulations of the associated invariants.  For these manifolds, one can of course write the invariants directly as composites using the preceding elementary pieces, resulting in expressions involving $\cC^\op$.  We find it more convenient to think of these algebraic invariant in terms of $\cC^\mp$, as discussed in the above remark, and so have reexpressed the invariants in those terms.  In these expressions, the indicated map specifies the action of the $\cC^\mp$ factor on the second copy of $\cC$, and is therefore written as a tensor functor into ``$\cC_2^\mp$".  These five circle invariants may be briefly denoted as $\cT^{**}(\cC)$, ${}^{**}\cT(\cC)$, $\cT(\cC)$, $\cT^{****}(\cC)$, and ${}^{****}\cT(\cC)$ respectively---these expressions dervie their names from the invariants in the first column.  The invariant $\Fun_{\cC \btimes \cC^\mp}(\cC,\cC)$ in the first row is called the Drinfeld center of $\cC$ and is often denoted $\cZ(\cC)$.  Computing the invariants in the right column makes use of Theorem~\ref{thm-evcoev} and Remark~\ref{remark-altintervals} above, as well as Lemma~\ref{Lma:FunctorsAsATensorPdt} and Remark~\ref{remark-tensorasfunctors}.

In Table~\ref{table-discs}, we record the invariants associated to 2-framed discs.

\subsection{Adjoints of bimodule functors: fusion categories are fully dualizable} \label{sec-df-functors}

In this section we specialize to $\TCrig$ and give sufficient conditions for a bimodule functor $\cF: {}_\cC \cM_\cD \rightarrow {}_\cC \cN_\cD$ to have a left adjoint and a right adjoint.  In particular, we show that any module functor between semisimple module categories over fusion categories has a left adjoint and a right adjoint. 

Recall from Lemma \ref{module-adjoint} that in order to check that a bimodule functor between bimodules over rigid tensor categories has an adjoint as a bimodule category, it's enough to check that the underlying functor has an adjoint.  In particular, for finite tensor categories, it's enough to check that the underlying functor is exact.

\begin{theorem}
Any $2$-morphism in $\TCss$ has a left adjoint and a right adjoint in $\TCss$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Any functor out of a semisimple category is exact.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
 $\TCss$ is fully 3-dualizable.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
This follows immediately from Theorems \ref{???}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
It is worth noting that we have not assumed that the base field is characteristic zero (although in characteristic $p$ we do need that the global dimension is nonzero), that the field is algebraically closed, or that the category is split semisimple.  

The latter observation has some consequences, as it shows that if $\cC$ has an incomplete rational form over a field $k$ (see \cite{???}), then the Turaev-Viro invariants attached to $\cC$ lie in this smaller field.  Previous constructions require that $\cC$ have a complete (or split) rational form.  For example, $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ has an incomplete rational form over $\QQ$, and thus the invariants lie in $\QQ$.  (In that specific case, we can see that more directly since $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ is Morita equivalent to $\Vec(G)$ and the latter has a complete rational form over $\QQ$.)
\end{remark}

Although the last step of this argument looks very straightforward, we warn the reader that it is not.  This argument depends crucially on the fact that $\TCss$ is a subcategory of $\TC$, that is to say on the theorem of ENO that the Deligne tensor product of semisimple module categories over a semisimple category of nonzero global dimension is semisimple.\NS{We should think through the multi-fusion version of this statement, the right condition is probably nonzero global dimension of all the component fusion categories.}  So we give another proof of dualizability which is more explicit.  This more explicit version also shows which parts of dualizability work for finite tensor categories and which don't.


%%% Stuff moved to section 2  -CSP

\begin{lemma} \label{lma:2morAdjunction}
Let $\cC, \cD \in \TCrig$, let $\cM, \cN \in \Hom_\TCrig(\cC,\cD)$, and let $\cF \in \Hom_{\TCrig}(\cM,\cN)$.  Suppose that $\cB$ is an auxiliary finite tensor category, that $\cM$ and $\cN$ are $\cB$-module categories, and that the underlying functor $\cF$ can be given the structure of a $\cB$-module functor.  If $\cM$ is exact as a $\cB$-module category, then $\cF$ has both a left adjoint functor and a right adjoint functor in $\Hom_{\TCrig}(\cN,\cM)$.  
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Exactness of $\cM$ as a $\cB$-module category guarantees that the underlying functor of $\cF$ is exact and thus has both left and right adjoints as a functor (Theorem \ref{Thm:ExactModCatOmnibus} (5)).  Then Lemma \ref{module-adjoint} shows that it has left and right adjoints as a $\cC$-$\cD$ bimodule functor.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
In applications of the above corollary $\cB$ will typically be $\mathrm{Vec}$, $\cC$, $\cD^{mp}$, or $\cC \boxtimes \cD^{mp}$.  When $\cB = \Vec$ this theorem is just the fact that functors out of semisimple categories are exact.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
The following bimodules are exact \NScomm{fill them in}.  If in addition $Z(\cC)$ is semisimple, then \NS{fill in} is also exact.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
If $\cC$ is a rigid finite tensor category such that $Z(\cC)$ is semisimple, then $\cC$ is fully dualizable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Semisimplicity of $Z(\cC)$ implies semisimplicity of $\cC$, since $\cC$ is exact as a $Z(\cC)$ module.  Thus the previous theorem is strictly weaker than the earlier theorem.  Nonetheless, it separates out the ``formal" part of the theorem, from the less formal proof that $Z(\cC)$ is semisimple.  In addition, this argument better shows what goes wrong in the non-semisimple case: we have no guarantee that functors out of ${}_\Vec Z(\cC)_\Vec$ have adjoints.  In particular, for non-semisimple categories there are problems defining the $3$-handles.
\end{remark}

\section{The Serre automorphism and the quadruple dual} \label{sec-serre}


\subsection{The universal Serre automorphism}
We now define the universal right Serre automorphism, which is a particular $1$-morphism in the $n$-framed bordism $n$-category.  We presume $n \geq 2$ throughout.  For any point $p \in \RR^n$ we can equip the embedding $p \hra \RR^n$ with the canonical coframing, therefore n-framing.  We refer to such a point as the standard positively-framed point---it is an object of $\FrBord_0^n$, and we denote it by $s$.  Consider the normally-oriented immersed 1-manifold $\cS \lra \RR^2$ depicted here:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[linestyle,fuzzright] 
(.7,0) to [out=180, in=20] (0,-.1)
	to [looseness=1.6, out=-160, in=180] (0,-.4)
	to [looseness=1.6, out=0, in=-20] (0,-.1)
	to [out=160, in=0] (-.7,0);
\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}
	\draw[->,outstyle] (.7,0) -- +(0:\arrowlength);
\end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\nid This manifold is 2-framed, therefore n-framed for any $n \geq 2$.  It can be viewed as a morphism in $\FrBord_0^n$ from $s$ to $s$.  This automorphism is called the \emph{universal right Serre automorphism}.  

\begin{remark}
Consider the interval $[0,1] \subset \RR$, viewed as a 1-dimensional bordism with one incoming and one outgoing boundary point.  Consider $n$-framings of this interval that restrict to the standard $n$-framing of both boundary points.  (Using the word ``restriction" here only makes sense because the tangent bundle of this interval has been canonically identified with $\RR$.)  This set of $n$-framings, considered up to homotopy, is a group under concatenation of intervals (applying the obvious shrinking diffeomorphisms as needed), and this group is canonically identified with $\pi_1(SO(n))$.  In particular, when $n=2$, the set of framings on this interval is canonically identified with $\ZZ$.  The right universal Serre automorphism is the framing corresponding to $+1$, while the left universal Serre automorphism is the framing corresponding to $-1$.  When we use the unspecified term ``Serre automorphism" we will always mean the right Serre automorphism.
\end{remark}

The name ``Serre automorphism" is motivated by the following example.

\begin{example}
\NScomm{Take example from Lurie Remark 4.2.4}
\end{example}

When $n>2$ we have that $\pi_1(\mathrm{SO}_n) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2$, which implies the following fact.

\begin{proposition}
When $n \geq 3$, the universal right Serre automorphism $\cS: s \ra s$ in $\FrBord_0^n$ is an involution; that is, $\cS \circ \cS : s \ra s$ is equivalent to the identity automorphism. 
\end{proposition}

Even better, there is a unique $3$-framed $2$-dimensional bordism of genus zero from $\cS \circ \cS$ to the trivial bordism; we call this genus zero bordism the canonical trivialization of the square of the Serre.  (As usual, stabilizing this bordism gives a canonical trivialization of the square of the Serre for any $n > 2$.)  This bordism is depicted below as a $2$-manifold immersed in $\RR^3$; here the bottom boundary is incoming, the top boundary is outgoing, and the coorientation points out of the page toward the reader near the bottom boundary.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{cobordism.png}
\end{center}

We denote this bordism $\cB$ and call it the universal belt map---if you wrap your belt into the configuration of the outgoing boundary and pull, it will happily (and very rapidly) trace out this bordism for you.

\begin{lemma}
The universal belt map is given by the following formula.  \NScomm{Write it as a composition of basic bordisms} 
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
Note that although the universal belt map is a $2$-dimensional bordism, it does not have a $2$-framing, but only a $3$-framing.  This fact is reflected in the above explicit formula, which includes an adjoint of one of the basic $2$-morphisms.  Thus, even though it's a $2$-dimensional bordism, it requires at least part of a $3$-dimensional theory to define.  
\end{remark}

\subsection{The Serre automorphism of a fusion category}

Suppose that $\cA$ is a symmetric monoidal $n$-category and that $a \in \cA$ is a fully dualizable object.  Then the image of the universal Serre automorphism gives an automorphism $\cS_a: a \rightarrow a$.

We would like to make this definition more explicit.  Let $\ev : a \otimes a^{\vee} \ra 1$ and $\coev: 1 \ra a^{\vee} \otimes a$ denote the evaluation and coevaluation maps for the duality between $a \in \cA$ and its dual $a^{\vee} \in \cA$.  Let $\ev^*: 1 \ra a \otimes a^{\vee}$ be the right adjoint to $\ev$.  Let $\tau: a \otimes a \ra a \otimes a$ denote the symmetric monoidal switch.  \CD{We should change all the $\vee$'s to $*$s everywhere for consistency, right?  (Even though the distinction serves a purpose at moments like this one.)}

\begin{proposition}
Let $a \in \cA$ be a dualizable object of the symmetric monoidal n-category $\cA$, for $n \geq 2$.  The Serre automorphism $\cS_a : a \ra a$ is equivalent to the following composite:
\[
\cS_a \simeq (\ev \btimes \id_a) \circ (\id_{a^{\vee}} \btimes \tau) \circ (\ev^{*} \btimes \id_a)
\]
\end{proposition}

We now specialize to our case of interest, namely where the object in question is a finite tensor categroy (which is a dualizable object in the $(3,2)$-category $\TCrig$).  The value of the Serre automorphism of such a tensor category was listed in a table in the previous section---we now make the calculation of the automorphism more explicit.

%\CD{Where did we establish that $\Hom_D(M,D)$ is a left/right adjoint to M, etc, and under what conditions? --- the identification of Serre depended on this!}

\begin{definition}
Suppose that $\cC$ is a finite tensor category and $\cF: \cC \rightarrow \cC$ is an automorphism of tensor categories.  Let ${}_\cC \cC(\cF)_\cC$ denote $\cC$ as a $\cC$--$\cC$ bimodule where the action is $x \cdot c \cdot y = \cF(x) \otimes c \otimes y$.  \NS{Say something about the natural transformation} \CD{I think this notation is slightly suboptimal.  What about ${}_{\cF}{\cC}$?  No, I guess that's no better.  How about ${}_{\langle \cF \rangle}{\cC}$?}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm-serre}
If $\cC$ is a finite tensor category, then the Serre bimodule $\bimod{\cC}{\cS}{\cC}$ for $\cC$ is equivalent as a bimodule category to $\cC(\ldd{(-)})$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We compute $\cS_a \simeq (\ev \btimes \id_a) \circ (\id_{a^{\vee}} \btimes \tau) \circ (\ev^{*} \btimes \id_a) \simeq (\ev \boxtimes \id_a) \circ (\id_a \boxtimes (\tau_{a^\vee,a} \circ  \ev^*))$ in two steps.  

First we consider $\tau_{a^\vee,a} \circ  \ev^*$.  By Lemma \ref{lem:dual-formula-for-adjoints}, $\ev^*$ is $\cC^{\op}$ as a $\Vect$--${\cC \boxtimes \cC^{\mp}}$ bimodule where the action is given by $m\cdot (x \boxtimes y) = {}^*y \otimes m \otimes x^*$ (here we've used that the left dual in $\cC^{\mp}$ is the right dual in $\cC$).  Hence, $\tau_{a^\vee,a} \circ  \ev^*$ is $\cC^{op}$ as a $\Vect$--$\cC^{mp} \boxtimes \cC$ bimodule, where the action is given by $c \cdot (y \boxtimes x) =  {}^*y \otimes c \otimes x^*$.  Taking right duals, we see that $\tau_{a^\vee,a} \circ  \ev^*$ equivalent to $\cC$ as a $\Vect$--$\cC^{mp} \boxtimes \cC$ bimodule, where the action is given by $c \cdot (y \boxtimes x) =  {}^{**}y \otimes c \otimes x$.

Now we compose with $\ev \boxtimes \id_a$, which just turns a right $\cC^{\mp}$ action into a left $\cC$ action.  So $\cS_a$ is equivalent to $\cC$ as a  $\cC$--$\cC$ bimodule, where the action is given by $y \cdot c \cdot x=  {}^{**}y \otimes c \otimes x$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
If $\cC$ is a fusion category, then $\cC({}^{****}(-)) \cong \cC(\id)$.
\end{corollary}

We would like to turn this into a statement about the functor ${}^{****}(-)$.

\begin{lemma}
Suppose that $\cF$ is a $\cC$--$\cC$ bimodule equivalence $\cC(\id) \rightarrow \cC(\alpha)$, then $\cF(1)$ is invertible and $\alpha$ is naturally isomorphic as a monoidal functor to the conjugation functor $c \mapsto \cF(1) c \cF(1)^{-1}$.  
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
$\cF(1)$ is invertible because it generates $\cC$ as a right module category.  The natural transformation from $\alpha$ to conjugation by $\cF(1)$ is determined by the composite $$c = \cF(1)^{-1} \cF(1) c \mapsto \cF(1)^{-1} \cF(c) \mapsto \cF(1)^{-1} \alpha(c) \cF(1),$$ where the first map is the natural transformation coming from right module functor structure on $\cF$ and the second map is the natural transformation coming from the left module structure on $\cF$.  This natural isomorphism is monoidal, as required.  \CDcomm{Why not write the above transformation directly as
$$\alpha(c) = \alpha(c) \cF(1) \cF(1)^{-1} \mapsto \cF(c) \cF(1)^{-1} \mapsto \cF(1) c \cF(1)^{-1}$$?}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The quadruple dual is equivalent to conjugation by some invertible object $X$.
\end{corollary}

Recall that not only do we know that $\cC({}^{****}(-)) \cong \cC(\id)$, we actually have a canonical natural isomorphism given by the image of the universal belt map.  We call the image of this map the belt map $\cB_\cC: \cC \rightarrow \cS \boxtimes_\cC \cS$.  The belt map $\cB_\cC$ gives a canonical choice of invertible object $X$ in the above corollary, and gives a canonical natural isomorphism between the quadruple dual and conjugation by the canonical invertible object $X$.

\begin{theorem} 
For a fusion category $\cC$ the canonical invertible object is trivial.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\NS{Look at CSP's proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The canonical isomorphism betweeen the quadruple dual and the trivial is characterized by ???.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{The Serre automorphism for finite tensor categories}

Recall that although finite tensor categories are not fully dualizable, they are fully $2$-dualizable and furthermore most of the basic $3$-morphisms have adjoints.  The latter fact suggests that there should be a fully extended $3$-dimensional field theory which is only defined on certain $3$-morphisms (this is called a ``non-compact" field theory in Lurie).  In particular, we should expect that the $2$-framed $2$-dimensional field theory attached to a finite tensor category has a canonical descent to a $3$-framed theory.  We plan to address this in more detail in a later paper, so we will be brief in this section and not try for the strongest results.

\begin{theorem}
The $2$-framed $2$-dimensional TFT attached to a rigid finite tensor category to a $3$-framed $2$-dimensional TFT has a canonical lift to a $2$-framed theory given by the canonical trivialization $\cdot^{****} \rightarrow D \cdot D^{-1}$ where $D$ is the canonical invertibale object.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

The above result is unsatisfactory in two ways.  First, it does not give a topological reason for the appearance of $3$-framings.  We would prefer to have a partially defined $3$-dimensional theory which explains the appearance of a structure group which is naturally attached to $3$-dimensional theories.  Second, it relies on a non-topological proof of Radford's theorem.  These two defects are closely related: a partially defined $3$-dimensional TFT would be automatically $3$-framed and thus would give a topological proof of Radford's theorem.  In fact, as we saw in the last section, most of the $2$-handles automatically have adjoints.  This suggests that most of the $3$-handles can be defined, in particular enough of them to give a topological proof of Radford's theorem.

It is an important philosophical point that algebraic applications of the cobordism hypothesis do not rely on the full strength of the cobordism hypothesis.  Any given application uses specific relationships between specific bordisms, and thus only relies on a very small part of the full topological field theory.  In particular, if you look at the explicit formula for the universal belt map, we don't need a full $3$-dimensional field theory, we only need that the $2$-framed saddle has an adjoint.  Thus, rather than rigorously constructing a non-compact field theory, if all we want is Radford's theorem we can just write down formulas for the particular bordisms that we need and check that those formulas work.

\begin{theorem}
If $\cC$ is a finite tensor category, then the formula ??? gives an isomorphism between $\cC$ and $\cS \boxtimes_\cC \cS$.  Furthermore, under this map the image of $1$ is the canonical invertible $X$, and we have that the quadruple dual is canonical equivalent to conjugation by $X$ via a map satisfying the following property.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

Another way to think of Radford's theorem is that it states that there's an equivalence between the left Serre automorphism and the right Serre automorphism.  Recalling the definitions of these two automorphisms, that's the same as saying that the left adjoint of blah is canonically equivalent to the right adjoint of blah.  This version of the statement has a vast generalization which again is inspired by the cobordism hypothesis but does not rely on the proof of the cobordism hypothesis.

%\CSP{This proposition is stated as a remark, without proof in Jacob's paper.}

\begin{proposition}[Lurie, Remark 3.4.22] \label{prop-ambiadjoints}
	Let $\cA$ be a symmetric monoidal 3-category. Let $f: x \to y$ be a 1-morphism in $\cA$, and suppose that $f$ admits a right adjoint $f^R$,  so we have unit and counit maps $u:id_x \to f^R \circ f$ and $v:f \circ f^R \to id_y$. If $u$ and $v$ admit left adjoints $u^L$ and $v^L$, then $u^L$ and $v^L$ exhibit $f^R$ also as a left adjoint to $f$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By assumption we are given 3-morphisms,
\begin{align*}
	\varepsilon_v: v^L \circ v & \Rightarrow id_{f \circ f^R} \\
	\eta_v: id_{id_y} & \Rightarrow v \circ v^L \\
	\varepsilon_u: u^L \circ u & \Rightarrow id_{id_x} \\
	\eta_u: id_{f^R \circ f} & \Rightarrow  u \circ u^L
\end{align*}
which satisfy the Zig-Zag identities:
\begin{align*}
	 id_v  &= (id_v * \varepsilon_v) \circ (\eta_v * id_v)  \\
	 id_{v^L}  &= (\varepsilon_v * id_{v^L} ) \circ (id_{v^L} * \eta_v)  \\
	 id_u  &= (id_u * \varepsilon_u) \circ (\eta_u * id_u)  \\
	 id_{u^L}  &= (\varepsilon_u * id_{u^L} ) \circ (id_{u^L} * \eta_u).  
\end{align*}
We must show that the following Zig-Zag identities hold:
\begin{align*}
	 (id_{f} * u^L) \circ (v^L * id_{f} ) & \cong id_{f} \\
 	 (u^L * id_{f^R}) \circ (id_{f^R} * v^L) & \cong id_{f^R} 
\end{align*}
By assumption we may also choose isomorphisms as follows:

\section{Pivotality as a descent condition} \label{sec-pivot}

\subsection{Homotopically invariant notions of pivotality and sphericality.}

Fusion categories are objects of the 3-category $\TC$ of tensor categories, but in this 3-category, pivotality and sphericality are not natural conditions on a fusion category.  Specifically they are not homotopy invariant notions; one may have a pivotal (resp. spherical) fusion category and a $\TC$-equivalent fusion category that is not pivotal (resp. spherical).  \CD{That statement should be double checked.}  We introduce the following homotopy invariant notions.

Recall that a pivotal structure is a tensor trivialization of the double dual functor.

\begin{definition}
An \emph{h-pivotal} structure on a fusion category $\cC$ is an equivalence $T: \bimod{\cC}{\cC}{\cC} \ra \bimod{\cC}{\cD}{\cC}$ from the identify bimodule $\bimod{\cC}{\cC}{\cC}$ to the bimodule $\bimod{\cC}{\cD}{\cC}$ associated to the double right dual tensor functor $(-)^{**}: \cC \ra \cC$.  
\end{definition}

\nid As we saw in Theorem [...] that the double dual bimodule is canonically equivalent to the Serre bimodule, an h-pivotal structure could equally well have been defined as a trivialization of the Serre bimodule.  Of course, we need to know what the morphisms between h-pivotal structures are: an equivalence from an h-pivotal structure $T$ on $\cC$ to another h-pivotal structure $T'$ is a natural equivalence of bimodule functors from $T$ to $T'$.

Recall that a spherical structure is a tensor trivialization of the double dual functor whose double is the canonical tensor trivialization of the quadruple dual.  In Section [...] we explicitly described the corresponding canonical trivialization $A : \bimod{\cC}{\cC}{\cC} \ra \bimod{\cC}{\cQ}{\cC}$ of the bimodule $\bimod{\cC}{\cQ}{\cC}$ associated to the quadruple right dual tensor functor $(-)^{****}: \cC \ra \cC$. \CD{Reconsider the phrasing here after the section on the quad dual is written.}

\begin{definition}
An \emph{h-spherical} structure on a fusion category $\cC$ is a pair $(T,E)$, where $T: \bimod{\cC}{\cC}{\cC} \ra \bimod{\cC}{\cD}{\cC}$ is an equivalence from the identity bimodule to the bimodule associated to the double right dual tensor functor, and $E: T \btimes_{\cC} T \ra A$ is a natural equivalence of bimodule functors from $T \btimes_{\cC} T: \bimod{\cC}{\cC \btimes_{\cC} \cC}{\cC} \ra \bimod{\cC}{\cD \btimes_{\cC} \cD}{\cC} \cong \bimod{\cC}{\cQ}{\cC}$ to the canonical trivialization $A : \bimod{\cC}{\cC}{\cC} \ra \bimod{\cC}{\cQ}{\cC}$ of the quadruple dual bimodule.
\end{definition}

An equivalence from an h-spherical structure $(T,E)$ on $\cC$ to another h-spherical structure $(T',E')$ is a natural equivalence $R: T \ra T'$ of bimodule functors that intertwines $E$ and $E'$ in the sense that the composite $T \btimes_{\cC} T \xra{R \btimes R} T' \btimes_{\cC} T' \xra{E'} A$ is equal to the map $T \btimes_{\cC} T \xra{E} A$.

Our main reason for investigating h-pivotal and h-spherical structures is, of course, that these are the notions that naturally correspond to descent properties of the corresponding field theories.  Another advantage is that because they are the homotopically natural notions, the groupoids of these structures admit particularly clean classifications, as follows.

\begin{proposition}
The groupoid of h-pivotal structures on an h-pivotal fusion category $\cC$ is a torsor for the braided monoidal category $\pi_{\leq 1} \Omega^2(\TC,\cC)$, that is the fundamental groupoid of the double loop category of $\TC$, based at $\cC$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
The groupoid of h-spherical structures on an h-spherical fusion category $\cC$ is a torsor for the braided monoidal category $K := \ker(\pi_{\leq 1} \Omega^2(\TC,\cC) \xra{\cdot 2} \pi_{\leq 1} \Omega^2(\TC,\cC))$.
\end{proposition}

Needless to say, the kernel in this proposition must be interpreted in a homotopy invariant manner, that is as a homotopy fiber and not a literal fiber.  Specifically, an object in the kernel $K$ is an automorphism $\phi$ of the identity bimodule $\bimod{\cC}{\cC}{\cC}$ together with a natural equivalence of bimodule functors from $\phi \btimes \phi$ to the identity functor on $\cC \btimes_{\cC} \cC$.  We refer to this tensor squaring operation $\phi \mapsto \phi \btimes \phi$ as ``$\cdot 2$", rather than as squaring, because the fundamental groupoid of the double loop space of $\TC$ is homotopy abelian.

Once the somewhat intricate definitions involved in these two propositions are unpacked, they are transparent, and we omit the proofs. \CD{Check this.}

\subsection{h-Pivotal fusion categories correspond to quadratic field theories} \label{sec-pivot-orpo}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm-hpivotal}
A fusion category $\cC \in \TC$ is h-pivotal if and only if the framed local field theory $\cF_{\cC} : \FrBord_0^3 \ra \TC$ associated to $\cC$ descends to a quadratic field theory $\overline{\cF_{\cC}} : \QuadBord_0^3 \ra \TC$.  In fact, the groupoid of h-pivotal structures on $\cC$ is equivalent to the groupoid of lifts of $\cF_{\cC}$ to a quad field theory.
\end{theorem}


\begin{conjecture}
If a fusion category $\cC \in \TC$ is pivotal, then the framed local field theory $\cF_{\cC} : \FrBord_0^3 \ra \TC$ associated to $\cC$ descends to a combed, that is $SO(2)$, local field theory.
\end{conjecture}

\CDcomm{Conjecture regarding exact structure group for pivotal?}

\subsection{h-Spherical fusion categories correspond to oriented $p_1$ field theories}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm-hspherical}
A fusion category $\cC \in \TC$ is h-spherical if and only if the framed local field theory $\cF_{\cC} : \FrBord_0^3 \ra \TC$ associated to $\cC$ descends to an oriented $p_1$ field theory $\overline{\cF_{\cC}} : \OrpoBord_0^3 \ra \TC$.  In fact, the groupoid of h-spherical structures on $\cC$ is equivalent to the groupoid of lifts of $\cF_{\cC}$ to an oriented $p_1$ field theory.
\end{theorem}

\begin{conjecture}
If a fusion category $\cC \in \TC$ is spherical, then the framed local field theory $\cF_{\cC} : \FrBord_0^3 \ra \TC$ associated to $\cC$ descends to an oriented, that is $SO(3)$, local field theory.
\end{conjecture}

\CDcomm{Conjecture regarding exact structure group for spherical?}

%\subsection{Examples of descent} \label{sec-egs-descent}

\CDcomm{Somewhere we need to add examples of specific fusion categories, with a discussion of which structures they have and the classification of those structures.  Not sure if that is a new subsection here or just fits as examples along the way in other subsections.}

\subsection{Field theory descent conjectures}

Etignof, Nikshych, and Ostrik conjectured that all fusion categories are pivotal.  In light of Theorem~\ref{thm-hpivotal}, a topological analog of this pivotality conjecture is the following:
\begin{conjecture}
Every framed local field theory with values in tensor categories descends to a $\Quad$ local field theory.
\end{conjecture}
In fact we believe rather more:
\begin{conjecture}
Every framed local field theory with values in tensor categories descends to an oriented local field theory.
\end{conjecture}
\CDcomm{We know that this conjecture actually implies the ENO conjecture, right? [ie that oriented implies spherical]}
Note that it is not possible to prove this conjecture ``in stages" by passing from framed field theories to $\Quad$ field theories to $\Orpo$ field theories to oriented field theories.  Indeed, there are, for instance, $\TC$-valued $\Orpo$ field theories that do not descend to oriented field theories.  \CDcomm{[Right?]}


\subsection{This section to be removed after comment addressed} \label{sec-pivot-struc}

\begin{conjecture}
Every oriented-$p_1$ local field theory with values in tensor categories descends to an oriented local field theory.
\end{conjecture}
\CDcomm{[9/24/11] We now know that this conjecture is false, right?  That is, it is possible to pick Morita spherical structures with nontrivial anomaly.}

\appendix

\setcounter{theorem}{0}
\section*{Appendix.  Homotopy types of 3-dimensional structure groups}

In this appendix we describe a few auxillary structure groups, including the spin and string groups, and record some computations regarding the homotopy and homology of the various structure spaces.
%!% Need to credit Andre with helping understand all this.

\begin{definition}
The following spaces, together with the obvious maps to $BO(3)$, define 3-dimensional bundle structures:
\begin{itemize}
\item[Spin:] $BSpin(3) := \hofib(BSO(3) \xra{w_2} K(\ZZ/2,2))$
\item[Spinpo:] $BSpinpo(3) := \hofib(BSpin(3) \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4)$
\item[String:] $BString(3) := \hofib(BSpin(3) \xra{(p_1)/2} K(\ZZ,4))$
\item[hString:] $BhString(3) := \hofib(BSpin(3) \xra{(p_1)/4} K(\ZZ,4))$
\item[2-Frame:] $BTwFrame(3) := \hofib(BSO(3) \ra BSpin(6)) = B\Omega(Spin(6)/SO(3))$
\item[StFrame:] $BStFrame(3) := \hofib(BO(3) \ra BO(\infty)) = B\Omega(O(\infty)/O(3))$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\nid In the definition of 2-Frame, the inclusion from $SO(3)$ to $Spin(6)$ is the canonical lift of the map $SO(3) \ra SO(6)$ sending $\phi$ to $\phi \oplus \phi$; hence the idea of framing twice the vector bundle, hence the name.  In order for the definitions of $BString(3)$ and $BhString(3)$ to be sensible, the composite $BSpin(3) \ra BSO(3) \ra BSO \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4)$, which we have refered to simply as $p_1$, must be uniquely 4-divisible; we will see presently that this is indeed the case.  Note that for our purposes it suffices to define the first Pontryagin class $p_1 \in H^4(BSO;\ZZ)$ as a generator.

\begin{proposition} \label{prop-H4}
The diagram of structure spaces
\begin{equation} \nn
\xymatrix@R=5pt{
& BSpin \ar[dr] & & \\
BSpin(3) \ar[ur] \ar[dr] && BSO \ar[r]^{p_1} & K(\ZZ,4) \\
& BSO(3) \ar[ur] & &
}
\end{equation}
induces on fourth homotopy and fourth homology respectively the maps
\begin{equation} \nn
\xymatrix@R=5pt{
\save[]+<-1cm,0cm>*{\pi_4:}\restore & \ZZ \ar[dr]^{1} & & \\
\ZZ \ar[ur]^{2} \ar[dr]_{1} && \ZZ \ar[r]^{2} & \ZZ \\
& \ZZ \ar[ur]_{2} & & \\
&&& \\
\save[]+<-1cm,0cm>*{H^4:}\restore & \ZZ \ar[dl]_{2} & & \\
\ZZ && \ZZ \ar[ul]_{2} \ar[dl]^{1} & \ZZ \ar[l]_{1} \\
& \ZZ \ar[ul]^{4} & &
}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

We emphasize from this proposition two facts that were directly needed for the structure group computations in Section~\ref{sec-lft-struc}: the composite $BSO(3) \ra BSO \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4)$ is a generator of $H^4(BSO(3);\ZZ)$, which we refer to also as $p_1$, and the map $\pi_4(BSO(3)) \xra{\pi_4(p_1)} \pi_4(K(\ZZ,4))$ is multiplication by $4$.

\begin{proof}
The defining long exact sequences show that $\pi_4(BSpin(3) \ra BSO(3))$ and $\pi_4(BSpin \ra BSO)$ are isomorphisms.  The map $\pi_4(BSpin(3) \ra BSpin)$ is the same as $\pi_3(Spin(3) \ra Spin(5))$; the map $\pi_3(Spin(3) \ra Spin(4))$ is diagonal, and $\pi_3(Spin(4) \ra Spin(5))$ is addition. %!% Is there a nice clean way to see those two facts?
The map $\pi_4(BSO(3) \ra BSO)$ follows by commutativity, and the map $H^4(BSpin(3) \ra BSpin)$ follows by Hurewicz.

That the map $H^4(BSpin \ra BSO)$ is multiplication by 2 can be seen in the integral cohomology Serre spectral sequence for the fibration $BSpin \ra BSO \ra K(\ZZ/2,2)$, given knowledge of the cohomology of $BSO$ and $BSpin$.  Similarly that $H^4(BSpin(3) \ra BSO(3))$ is multiplication by 4 follows from the fibration $BSpin(3) \ra BSO(3) \ra K(\ZZ/2,2)$.  That $H^4(BSO(3) \ra BSO)$ is an isomorphism follows by commutativity.

The map $H^4(BSO \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4))$ is an isomorphism by definition of $p_1$.  The map $H^4(BSpin \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4))$ is thus multiplication by 2.  By Hurewicz it follows that $\pi_4(BSpin \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4)$ is multiplication by 2, and therefore that $\pi_4(BSO \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4))$ is also multiplication by 2.
\end{proof}

Figure~\ref{fig-structuregroups} organizes some of the 3-dimensional structure groups we have considered.

In Table~\ref{table-structurecalc}, we record the low-dimensional homology and homotopy of the structure spaces we have considered.  All these structure spaces are simply connected.  The remaining homology and homotopy groups follow from the above proposition, along with a number of classical computations, using a flurry of interconnected spectral sequences.

\caption{Low-dimensional cohomology and homotopy of structure spaces.} \label{table-structurecalc}
\end{table} \CD{Someone should recheck the cohomology of $Spin(6)/SO(3)$.}
% H^5 and pi_5 are necessary for computing H^4 and pi_5 of some of the other groups, so you can't just delete those whole columns.

The maps on $H^{\leq 4}$ and $\pi_{\leq 4}$, induced by maps between the structure spaces in the table, are as expected, aside from those already recorded in Proposition~\ref{prop-H4}.  Specifically, in addition to the homotopy of the maps between $BQuad$, $BSO(2)$, $BOrpo(3)$, and $BSO(3)$ recorded in Section~\ref{sec-lft-struc}, we have the following: $H^2(BQuad \ra BSO(2))$ is iso; $H^4(BSO(2) \ra BSO(3))$ is iso; $H^3(BSO(3) \ra BSO)$ is iso; $H^3(BOrpo(3) \ra BSO(3))$ is iso; $H^4(BString(3) \ra BSpinpo(3))$ and $H^4(BSpinpo(3) \ra BSpin(3))$ are surjective; $\pi_3(BString(3) \ra BSpinpo(3))$ is injective; and $\pi_3(BSpinpo(3) \ra BOrpo(3))$ is iso. %%% The map BSO(2) --> BSO(3) is from knowing that the mod 2 reduction of p_1 is w_2^2.

Note that in this table $BSO$ and $BSpin$ are not, per se, 3-dimensional structure spaces, as they do not map to $BO(3)$, and we mention them only as useful intermediary spaces.  One could define a \emph{stable} $BSO$-structure or $BSpin$-structure on a 3-dimensional vector bundle $M \ra BO(3)$ as a lift to $BSO$, respectively $BSpin$, of the composite $M \ra BO(3) \ra BO$; these might be called a stable orientation and stable spin structure respectively.  Note, though, that the pullback $\holim(BO(3) \ra BO \la BSO)$ is $BSO(3)$ and the pullback $\holim(BO(3) \ra BO \la BSpin)$ is $BSpin(3)$; it follows that a stable orientation is the same data as an orientation, and a stable spin structure is the same data as a spin structure.  (Though we will not need this fact, the same is true for orpo structures and stable orpo structures.)  This is certainly not the relation between stable framing, which is an $O(\infty)/O(3)$-structure, and framing, which is a $*$-structure.

The above table suggests three homotopical coincidences.  The most apparent is that $BhString(3)$ is 4-connected.  The natural forgetful map from the set of homotopy classes of framings of a 3-manifold $M$ to the set of homotpy classes of $hString(3)$-structures on $M$ is therefore an isomorphism.  We also see a coincidence between the low-dimensional invariants of $BOrpo(3)$ and $Spin(6)/SO(3)$ and between those of $BString(3)$ and $O(\infty)/O(3)$.

Orpo structures and 2-framings are different; for instance, the set of homotopy classes of parametrized families of the two structures on a vector bundle can be genuinely distinct.  However, as far individual tangential structures on a single 3-manifold are concerned, they are homotopically indistinguishable---this convergence no doubt has contributed to some of the confusion in the literature.
\begin{proposition}
There is a canonical 4-connected map $Spin(6)/SO(3) \ra BOrpo(3)$ lifting the natural map $Spin(6)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3)$.  In particular, for a closed 3-manifold $M$, there is a canonical bijection between the orpo structures and the 2-framings on $M$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
From Proposition~\ref{prop-H4}, we know that $p_1$ is the generator of $H^4(BSO(3);\ZZ)$, and that $(p_1)/2$ is the generator of $H^4(BSpin(6);\ZZ)$---the fourth cohomology is of $BSpin(6)$ is stable.  Observe that the map $BSO(3) \ra BSpin(6)$ induces an isomorphism on $H^4$.  The first Pontryagin class $BSO(3) \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4)$ therefore factors as $BSO(3) \ra BSpin(6) \xra{(p_1)/2} K(\ZZ,4)$.  The composite $Spin(6)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3) \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4)$ then factors as $Spin(6)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3) \ra BSpin(6) \xra{(p_1)/2} K(\ZZ,4)$.  This last composite has a canonical null-homotopy, because the first two maps form a homotopy fibration.  There is therefore a canonical lift of $Spin(6)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3)$ to a map $Spin(6)/SO(3) \ra BOrpo(3)$.

As both $Spin(6)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3)$ and $BOrpo(3) \ra BSO(3)$ are isomorphisms on $\pi_2$, the lift is certainly an isomorphism on $\pi_2$.  The map $Spin(6)/SO(3) \ra BOrpo(3)$ induces a map from $Spin(6) = \hofib(Spin(6)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3))$ to $K(\ZZ,3) = \hofib(BOrpo(3) \ra BSO(3))$ that is an isomorphisms on $\pi_3$.  Since both $Spin(6) \ra Spin(6)/SO(3)$ and $K(\ZZ,3) \ra BOrpo(3)$ are surjective on $\pi_3$, it follows that $Spin(6)/SO(3) \ra BOrpo(3)$ is an isomorphism on $\pi_3$, as needed.
\end{proof} % "Observe" means "do some unpleasant spectral sequence computations"
% It is implicitly used---really used---in this proof that the third homotopy groups are the same, and that depends on $BSO(3) \xra{\widetilde{\phi \oplus \phi}} BSpin(6)$ being multiplication by $4$ on $\pi_4$ --- of course this is recorded in the table.

Similarly, as far as individual tangential structures on 3-manifolds are concerned, there is a homotopical coincidence between stably framed structures and string structures.
\begin{proposition}
There is a canonical 4-connected map $O(\infty)/O(3) \ra BString(3)$ lifting the natural map $O(\infty)/O(3) \ra BO(3)$.  In particular, for a closed 3-manifold $M$, there is a canonical bijection between the stable framings and the string structures on $M$.
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proof}
As $O(\infty)/O(3)$ is the same as $SO(\infty)/SO(3)$, and the map $O(\infty)/O(3) \ra BO(3)$ is the composite $SO(\infty)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3) \ra BO(3)$, it suffices to work the special orthogoanl quotient throughout.

Let $P$ denote the homotopy fiber of the generating map $K(\ZZ/2,2) \ra K(\ZZ,5)$.  By construction we have a homotopy fibration $BString(3) \ra BSO(3) \ra P$.  Moreover, appealing in part to the homotopy calculation in Proposition~\ref{prop-H4}, we see that the map $BSO(3) \ra P$ factors as $BSO(3) \ra BSO(\infty) \ra P$.  Note that the map $BSO(\infty) \ra P$ is an isomorphism on $\pi_4$.  The map $SO(\infty)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3) \ra P$ can now be factored as $SO(\infty)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3) \ra BSO(\infty) \ra P$.  The first two maps in this composite form a homotopy fibration and therefore admit a canonical null-homotopy.  There is therefore a canonical lift of $SO(\infty)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3)$ to a map $SO(\infty)/SO(3) \ra BString(3)$.

The map $SO(\infty)/SO(3) \ra BString(3)$ induces a map from $SO(\infty) = \hofib(SO(\infty)/SO(3) \ra BSO(3))$ to $\Omega P = \hofib(BString(3) \ra BSO(3))$.  This map $SO(\infty) \ra \Omega P$ is an ismorphisms on $\pi_3$, because the map $BSO(\infty) \ra P$ was an isomorphism on $\pi_3$.  As both the maps $SO(\infty) \ra SO(\infty)/SO(3)$ and $\Omega P \ra BString(3)$ are surjective on $\pi_3$, it follows that $SO(\infty)/SO(3) \ra BString(3)$ is an isomorphism on $\pi_3$, as needed.
\end{proof}

This proposition associates to each stable framing of a 3-manifold $M$ a string structure.  This association may be thought of as follows: because the fibration $BString(3) \ra BO(3)$ is the pullback of the fibration $BString \ra BO$ along the inclusion $BO(3) \ra BO$, the data of a lift of $M \ra BO(3)$ to $BString(3)$ is the same as the data of a lift of $M \ra BO(3) \ra BO$ to $BString$.  That is, string structures and stable string structures are identical notions.  Now note that there is a natural forgetful map from stable framings to stable string structures, since a trivialization of the composition $M \ra BO(3) \ra BO$ certainly provides a lift of that composite to, in particular, $BString$.

In the main text, we have concentrated on the structure groups $BQuad$, $BSO(2)$, $BOrpo(3)$, and $BSO(3)$.  As we have seen, $hString(3)$-structures are essentially just framings, but $String(3)$-structures appear to be rather different.  It turns out, though, that provided we focus on fusion categories over the complex numbers, all $\TC$-valued field theories are in fact string:

\begin{proposition} \label{prop-string}
Every framed local field theory $\cF : \FrBord_0^3 \ra \TC$ with target tensor categories over $\CC$ descends to a string local field theory $\overline{\cF} : \StrBord_0^3 \ra \TC$.
\end{proposition}

\nid This result is a direct analog of the corresponding result for conformal-net-valued local field theories, given in~\cite{bdh-lft}, and the proof is the same.

Let $A$ be a finite set. We define a strict 2-category $\lincat(A)$ as follows. Let $P(A)$ denote the powerset of $A$, and let $S$, $S'$, and $S''$ denote various disjoint subsets of $A$. The objects of $\lincat(A)$ consist of  $P(A)$-tuples of objects in $\lincat$, together with some additional data. Thus we have a finite linear category $X(S)$ for each subset $S \subseteq A$. The additional data consists of bilinear functors
\begin{align*}
		x_{S,S'}: & \; X(S) \times X(S') \to X(S \sqcup S') \\
		I: & \; \Vect \to X(\emptyset)
\end{align*}
and natural isomorphisms of multi-linear functors
\begin{align*}
		\alpha_{S, S', S''}:  & \; x_{S \sqcup S', S''}\circ (x_{S,S'} \times 1) \cong x_{S, S' \sqcup S''} \circ (1 \times x_{S', S''}) \\
		r_S: & \; x_{S, \emptyset} \circ (1 \times I)  \cong  \textrm{can}^r \\
		\ell_{S}: & \; x_{ \emptyset, S} \circ (I \times 1)  \cong  \textrm{can}^\ell
\end{align*}
where $\textrm{can}^r: X(S) \times \Vect \to X(S)$ is the canonical bilinear functor, and similarly for $\textrm{can}^\ell$. 
Moreover this data is subject to the following conditions: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $x_{S,S'}$ realizes $X(S \sqcup S')$ as the Deligne tensor product  $X(S) \boxtimes X(S') $, and $I$ is an isomorphism of linear categories. 
	\item $	\alpha_{S, S', S''}$ satisfies the evident pentagon identity. 
	\item $\ell_S$, $r_S$, and $\alpha_{\emptyset, S, \emptyset}$ satisfy the evident triangle identity.
\end{enumerate}

A morphism $f:X \to Y$ in $\lincat(A)$ consists of a $P(A)$-tuple of linear functors $f_S: X(S) \to Y(S)$, together with natural isomorphisms of bilinear functors $\phi_{S,S'}: y_{S,S'} \circ f_S \times f_{S'} \cong f_{S \sqcup S'} \circ x_{S,S'}$. For each triple $S$, $S'$, $S''$ of disjoint subset of $A$, the following hexagon identity holds,
\begin{equation*}
	[1 * \alpha^X_{S, S', S''}] \circ [\phi_{S \sqcup S', S''} * 1] \circ [1 *(\phi_{S, S'} \times 1)] = 
		[\phi_{S, S' \sqcup S''} * 1] \circ [1 * (1 \times \phi_{S', S''})] \circ [\alpha^Y_{S,S', S''} * 1].
\end{equation*}

A 2-morphism $\theta: f \to g$ in $\lincat(A)$ consists of a $P(A)$-tuple of linear natural transformations $\theta_S: f_S \to g_S$, such that for every pair of disjoint subsets $S$, $S'$ of $A$ the following identity holds: 
\begin{equation*}
	(\theta_{S\sqcup S'}* 1) \circ \phi^f_{S,S'} = \phi^g_{S,S'} \circ (1 * (\theta_S \times \theta_{S'})).
\end{equation*}

One readily verifies that $\lincat(A) \simeq \lincat^{\times A}$. Thus an object of $\lincat(A)$ can roughly be thought of as consisting of an $A$-tuple of linear categories. However the object of $\lincat(A)$ also includes choices of representatives for the possible Deligne tensor products of these linear categories. The assignment $A \mapsto \lincat(A)$ gives a strict functor from $\Gamma^\op \simeq \Fin_*$ to strict 2-categories, which by abuse of notation we will also denote by $\lincat$.

\subsection{The symmetric monoidal 2-categories of tensor categories and bimodule categories}

Let $\TC(A)$ be the collection of all sextuples $(X, \otimes, \mathbf{1}, \alpha, \ell, r)$ where $X \in \lincat(A)$,  $\otimes: \Delta^*(X \boxtimes X) \to X$, $\mathbf{1}: \Vect \to X$, $\alpha$, $\ell$, $r$ are the associator and unitors, satisfying the usual conditions.

%Fix a finite set $A$. This gives rise to a functor $j_A: \Delta \to \Gamma$ which sends the ordered set $[m]$ to the set $\sqcup_m A = \{ (a,i) \; | \; a \in A, \; 0 < i \leq m \} $, and sends $f: [m] \to [n]$ to the function $ (a,i) \mapsto \{ (a,j) \in \sqcup_n A \; | \; f(i-1) < j \leq f(i) \}$. Composing with $\lincat$ gives a strict simplicial 2-category. In particular for each object $X \in \lincat(\sqcup_n A)$ and each $\varphi: [m] \to [n]$ in $\Delta$, we obtain an object $\varphi^*X \in \lincat(\sqcup_m A)$.

%Another important simplicial 2-category, is the terminal simplcial 2-category, which is the constant functor with value the terminal 2-category $pt$. A semi-lax natural transformation from $pt$ to $\lincat \circ j_A$ consists of a family of objects $\{ X_n \in \lincat(\sqcup_n A)\}$ together with functors $X_\varphi: \varphi^*X_n \to X_m$ and natural isomorphisms $\phi_{\varphi, \psi}: X_\varphi \circ \varphi^* X_\psi \cong X_{\psi \varphi}$ for each $\varphi: [m] \to [n]$ and $\psi: [n] \to [p]$ in $\Delta$. These natural isomorphisms are required to satisfy the pentagon identity. There is a 2-category of such natural transformations. 

%For each $1 \leq i \leq n$, let $s_i: [1] \to [n]$ denote the {\em Segal inclusion} which maps $0\mapsto i-1$, and $1 \mapsto i$. 
%
%\begin{definition}
%	A {\em tensor category} in $\lincat(A)$ is a semi-lax natural transformation $X: pt \to \lincat \circ j_A$ such that the functors $X_{s_i}: s_i^*X_n \to X_1$ are equivalences. 
%\end{definition}
%
%In the case that $A = (1) = \{1\}$, this is essentially equivalent to the usual notion of a tensor category. 








%There is a functor $\varphi:\Delta \to \Gamma$, which sends $[m]$ to the set $(m) = \{ 1, 2, \dots, m\}$, and sends $f: [m] \to [n]$ to the function $\varphi_f: i \in (m) \mapsto \{ j \in (n) \; | \: f(i-1) < j \leq f(i) \}$.


%The first significant advantage of $n$-fold Segal categories follows from the fact that the homotopy fiber product over a discrete base, for example $X_m \times_{X_0}^h X_n$ when $X$ is an $n$-fold Segal category, agrees with the ordinary fiber product. Thus we many avoid a lengthly discussion of the model structure of $n$-fold complete Segal spaces and work directly with ordinary fiber products.

%We must also identify the weak equivalences between $n$-fold Segal categories. These admit a fairly direct inductive description in terms of the homotopy category $hX$ of an $n$-fold Segal category.



%-----


%The {\em homotopy pull-back} of $n$-fold simplicial spaces may be inductively defined as follows. For $0$-fold simplicial spaces a homotopy pull-back is a homotopy pull-back in the standard model structure on simplicial sets. For general $n$-fold simplicial spaces $W$, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, a diagram

%\end{tikzpicture}
%\end{center}
%is a homotopy pull-back diagram of $(n-1)$-fold simplicial spaces. Thus homotopy fiber products are computed `levelwise'. In particular if $Z$ is a discrete $n$-fold simplicial space, then the homotopy fiber product is levelwise homotopy equivalent to the usual fiber product. 

	
	
%	We now inductively define a class of objects called {\em $n$-fold Segal spaces} as well as a collection of maps of $n$-fold Segal spaces called {\em weak equivalences}. For $0$-fold simplicial spaces Segal spaces are the Kan complexes. The weak equivalences between $0$-fold simplicial spaces are the weak equivalences of simplicial sets.

\CDcomm{[Definition of bimodules between tensor categories]}
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be tensor categories, and let $\bimod{A}{M}{B}$ and $\bimod{B}{N}{C}$ be bimodules.  The ``precomposite bimodule" $\bimod{A}{M \otimes_B N}{C}$ is the colimit of the three-stage two-sided bar construction:
\begin{equation} \nn
\bimod{A}{M \otimes_B N}{C} := \colim \left( M \dtimes A \dtimes A \dtimes N \righttriplearrows M \dtimes A \dtimes N \rightdoublearrows M \dtimes N \right)
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark} \CD{This remark is not written very precisely or correctly yet---should be fixed after the Deligne tensor is spelled out earlier on.}
By applying definition~\ref{def-colim}, one can write out explicitly the bimodule $\bimod{A}{M \otimes_B N}{C}$ given by the above colimit of the three-stage two-sided bar construction.  There is however an equivalent bimodule $\bimod{A}{M \otimes_B' N}{C}$ that admits a more compact description, as follows.  The objects of $\bimod{A}{M \otimes_B' N}{C}$ are the objects $m \otimes n$ of the tensor product $M \dtimes N$.  The morphisms are of two kinds: (m1) a morphism $\phi \otimes \psi : m \otimes n \ra m' \otimes n'$ for each pair of morphisms $\phi: m \ra m'$ in $M$ and $\psi: n \ra n'$ in $N$; (m2) a morphism $t_a : ma \otimes n \ra m \otimes an$ for each \CDcomm{triple $(m,a,n)$ ... }.  These morphisms are subject to the two relations: (r1) for each \CDcomm{triple $(\phi, \epsilon, \psi)$}, the composite $ma \otimes n \ra m \otimes an \ra m' \otimes a' n'$ equals the composite $ma \otimes n \ra m' a' \otimes n' \ra m' \otimes a' n'$; (r2) the composite $(ma)b \otimes n \ra ma \otimes bn \ra m \otimes a(bn)$ equals the composite $(ma)b \otimes n \ra m(ab) \otimes n \ra m \otimes (ab)n \ra m \otimes a(bn)$.

\begin{definition}
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be tensor categories, and let $\bimod{A}{M}{B}$ and $\bimod{B}{N}{C}$ be bimodules.  The composite bimodule $\bimod{A}{M \dtimes_B N}{C}$ is the idempotent completion of the precomposite bimodule:
\begin{equation} \nn
\bimod{A}{M \dtimes_B N}{C} := \IC \left( \bimod{A}{M \otimes_B N}{C} \right)

Let $A$ be a \CDcomm{...} monoidal indempotent complete linear category, and let $M$ and $N$ be $A$-modules.  If $N$ is idempotent complete, then $\Hom_A(M,N)$ is idempotent complete.

\begin{corollary}
For $A$ and $B$ tensor categories, and $M$ an $A$-$B$ bimodule, if $\bimod{A}{M}{B}$ has a right adjoint, then that right adjoint is $\bimod{B}{\Hom_A(M,A)}{A}$.
