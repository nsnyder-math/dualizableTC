\title{$3$-dimensional topology and finite tensor categories}

\begin{abstract}
The Turaev-Viro construction assigns to a spherical fusion category a 3-dimensional topological field theory.  We generalize this construction in two ways. First we construct a fully local 0123 extended TFT (improving on Balsam and Kirillov's 123 TFT).  Second, we relax the assumption of sphericality on the fusion category; an arbitrary fusion category gives a $3$-framed TFT while an additional choice of spherical structure yields an oriented TFT.  This correspondence between fusion categories and TFTs allows one to translate algebraic statements and arguments into topology and vice-versa.  We give two main examples of this correspondence.  We explain how various adjectives describing fusion categories (unitary, spherical, pivotal, etc.) correspond to topological adjectives describing the TFT (unoriented, oriented, spin${}^c$, etc.).  Also, we reprove the fact that the quadruple dual functor is trivial by showing that it is essentially equivalent to the fact that $\pi_1(\mathrm{SO}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2$.

\CDcomm{The story: ``Fusion categories provided local field theories, and the structure (pivotality) of the fusion category corresponds to the structure (spinness) of the local field theory."}

\CDcomm{We are aiming to keep this paper to 30 pages.}

An $n+1$-dimensional topological field theory, according to Atiyah and Segal, is a symmetric monoidal functor from the category of $n+1$-dimensional bordisms to the category of vector spaces.  So, a TFT assigns to any closed $n$-manifold a vector space, and to any bordism it assigns a linear function between the corresponding vector spaces.  In particular, to a closed $n+1$-manifold a TFT assigns an endomorphism of the trivial vector space, that is a scalar.  Thus, TFTs can be thought of as topological invariants which can be computed by chopping the manifold up into smaller pieces.  A fully local (or fully extended) TFT allows one to cut the manifold not just along codimension one boundaries, but allows boundaries with corners of arbitrary codimension.  To state this rigorously we must understand the structure of cobordisms with corners.  Just as ordinary bordisms from a symmetric monoidal category, bordisms with corners  form a symmetric monoidal $n$-category.  Rigorously, a fully local TFT is a functor of symmetric $n$-categories from the $n$-category of bordisms with corners to another symmetric monoidal $n$-category.  

The Turaev-Viro construction (as generalized by Ocneanu and Barrett--Westbury) assigns to any spherical fusion category a 3-dimensional topological field theory.  We generalize this construction in two ways.  First we construct a fully local $0123$ extended TFT.  This local TFT takes values in the $3$-category $\mathcal{TC}$ (whose whose objects, $1$-morphisms, $2$-morphisms, and $3$-morphisms are tensor categories, bimodule categories, functors, and natural transformations, respectively) and the fusion category arises as the image of a point.  Second, we relax the assumption of sphericality on the fusion category.  TFTs come in flavors depending on the topological structure put on the bordism category (e.g. orientation, spin structure, etc.).  An arbitrary fusion category gives a $3$-framed TFT while the additional choice of spherical structure gives an oriented TFT.

Each of these generalizations is inspired by the cobordism hypothesis (originally proposed by Baez-Dolan, but improved and proved by Lurie) which gives a classification of local TFTs.  This classification states that an $n$-dimensional $n$-framed local field theory is determined (up to isomorphism) by the image of a point, and furthermore the possible images of points are exactly the ``fully dualizable" objects in the target $n$-category.  Finally, other flavors of $n$-dimensional local field theories are given by homotopy fixed points of actions of certain groups on the fully dualizable objects.  In particular, being fully dualizable is a {\bf property} while being a homotopy fixed point is a {\bf choice of structure}.  Note that being fusion is a property (semisimple, finitely many simple objects), while being spherical is a structure (choice of natural isomorphism between the identity and the double dual).


\subsection{Background and motivation}

\subsection{Results}.

%%

The first half of the paper, sections~\ref{sec-lft} and~\ref{sec-dualfusion}, focuses on [local field theory in dimension three and the dualizability of fusion categories].

The main theorem:
\begin{theorem}
Fusion categories are dualizable.
\end{theorem}
%!% Keep this statement this short and snappy in the introduction.  In the main text it can be fleshed out with more precision about the ambient 3-category.

A key application of this theorem is the construction of a plethora of local field theories:
\begin{corollary}
For any fusion category there is a local topological quantum field theory whose value on a point is that fusion category.
\end{corollary}

In particular, the theorem provides localizations of Turaev-Viro field theories:
\begin{corollary}
There is a local field theory whose value on a circle is the center of the fusion category of representations of a loop group at (any nondegenerate?) level.
\end{corollary}
Of course, the fusion category of representations of a loop group is merely an example, and can be replaced by any fusion category here.  This result is related to recent work of Kirillov and Balsam~\cite{kirillovbalsam}, which constructs a semi-local (that is, $1+1+1$-dimensional) version of Turaev-Viro theory.  In particular, our $0+1+1+1$-dimensional theory has the same value on a circle as the Kirillov-Balsam theory.  
%!% Add?: Assuming widely believed statements about the classification of 123 theories, it follows that our theory agrees with KB on 123 manifolds.
%!% Add mention of how sphericality comes in?

%%

The second half of the paper, sections~\ref{sec-serre} and~\ref{sec-pivot}, focuses on [Serre/doubledual/pivotality].

The main theorem:
\begin{theorem}
The Serre automorphism of a fusion category $\cC$ is the bimodule associated to the double dual functor $**: \cC \ra \cC$.
\end{theorem}

Because the Serre automorphism is necessarily order 2, this theorem provides a simple topological proof of the following generalization (?) of a theorem of ENO:
\begin{corollary}
The quadruple dual functor $****: \cC \ra \cC$ on a fusion category is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor.
\end{corollary}

A key insight resulting from the field-theoretic perspective on fusion categories is that the ENO conjecture, namely that fusion categories are pivotal, is equivalent to the spin-independence of the topological field theories associated to fusion categories:
\begin{theorem}
A fusion category $\cC$ is pivotal if and only if the local field theory associated to $\cC$ is independent of spin structure.
\end{theorem}
A precise formulation of this result, in terms of a descent condition for the bordism structure group of the local field theory, is given in section~\ref{sec-pivot-orpo}.
%\begin{theorem}
%A fusion category $\cC$ is pivotal if and only if the tensor-category-valued local field theory $F_{\cC} : \StringBord_0^3 \ra \TC$ associated to $\cC$ descends to a field theory on oriented $p_1$ bordism.
%\end{theorem}

\CD{The organization of this section might well change as we decide what exactly we should include.}

\CDcomm{Our goal is to define $TC(3)$, ie [...].  We are not trying to include a huge discussion of all the different variations $TC(i)$, which can occur in DTCII.}



\subsection{Linear categories} \label{sec-tc-lincat}


.

\CSPcomm{I think we should just restrict  $\lincat$ to mean finite linear categories}

\CDcomm{[2Vect = idempotent complete additive categories enriched in Vect]}

\begin{definition} % This is from EGNO Definition 1.18.2.
	A $k$-linear abelian category $C$ is {\em finite} if 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $C$ has finite dimensional spaces of morphisms;
		\item every object of $C$ has finite length;
		\item $C$ has enough projectives, i.e. every simple object of $C$ has a projective cover; and
		\item there are finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects.  
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

It is well known that a finite linear category is equivalent to the category $\Mod{A}{}$ of finite dimensional modules over a finite dimensional $k$-algebra $A$. By a linear category we will mean a $k$-linear abelian category. 

%\CD{[Fix the ground ring to be $\CC$?  Linear categories will mean linear over $\CC$?]}

\begin{definition}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be linear categories. If $C$ is a linear category, a {\em bilinear functor} $A \times B \to C$ is a functor from the product category which is right-exact and linear in each variable. The {\em Deligne tensor product $A \boxtimes B$} (if it exists) is the universal linear category admitting a bilinear functor $\boxtimes: A \times B \to A \boxtimes B$. That is, there exists a bilinear functor $\boxtimes: A \times B \to A \boxtimes B$ which induces, for all linear categories $C$, an equivalence between the categories of bilinear functors $A \times B \to C$ and linear functors $A \boxtimes B \to C$. 
\end{definition}

The Deligne tensor products is unique up to an equivalence, which in turn is unique up to unique natural isomorphism. Said differently, the 2-category of linear categories representing the Deligne tensor product is contractible or empty (if no such product exists). 

\begin{proposition}[Deligne (Prop 5.13)]
	The Deligne tensor product $A \boxtimes B$ exists and is a finite linear category whenever $A$ and $B$ are finite. 
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Tensor products and colimits of linear categories} \label{sec-tc-tensorprod}

\begin{definition}
\CDcomm{[Definition of a tensor category, include all the conditions to be an object of the 3-category, ie indemp comp, etc.]}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} \label{def-colim}
\CDcomm{[colimits in the 2-category of (appropriate) linear categories]}
\end{definition}


We will have occasion to use both the opposite of a tensor category, and the monoidal opposite of a tensor category; we establish notation to distinguish them.  Given a tensor category $\cC$, we will denote by $\cC^{\op}$ the tensor category whose underlying linear category is opposite to the underlying linear category of $\cC$, and whose tensor structure is inherited from the tensor structure of $\cC$; we call it the "opposite tensor category".  By constrast, we will denote by $\cC^{\mp}$ the tensor category whose underlying linear category is the underlying linear category of $\cC$, and whose tensor structure is defined by $[a] \otimes [b] := [b \otimes a]$, where $[a]$ refers to the object $a \in \cC$ viewed as an object of $\cC^{\mp}$; we call this the "monoidal opposite tensor category".  Finally, there is $\cC^{\mop}$, which denotes the tensor category whose underlying linear category is $\cC^{\op}$ and whose tensor structure is inherited from the tensor structure of $\cC^{\mp}$; we call this the "opposite monoidal opposite tensor category".

\subsection{Tensor category bimodules and bimodule composition} \label{sec-tc-bimod}


\begin{definition}
\CDcomm{[Definition of bimodules between tensor categories]}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be tensor categories, and let $\bimod{A}{M}{B}$ and $\bimod{B}{N}{C}$ be bimodules.  The ``precomposite bimodule" $\bimod{A}{M \otimes_B N}{C}$ is the colimit of the three-stage two-sided bar construction:
\begin{equation} \nn
\bimod{A}{M \otimes_B N}{C} := \colim \left( M \dtimes A \dtimes A \dtimes N \righttriplearrows M \dtimes A \dtimes N \rightdoublearrows M \dtimes N \right)
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark} \CD{This remark is not written very precisely or correctly yet---should be fixed after the Deligne tensor is spelled out earlier on.}
By applying definition~\ref{def-colim}, one can write out explicitly the bimodule $\bimod{A}{M \otimes_B N}{C}$ given by the above colimit of the three-stage two-sided bar construction.  There is however an equivalent bimodule $\bimod{A}{M \otimes_B' N}{C}$ that admits a more compact description, as follows.  The objects of $\bimod{A}{M \otimes_B' N}{C}$ are the objects $m \otimes n$ of the tensor product $M \dtimes N$.  The morphisms are of two kinds: (m1) a morphism $\phi \otimes \psi : m \otimes n \ra m' \otimes n'$ for each pair of morphisms $\phi: m \ra m'$ in $M$ and $\psi: n \ra n'$ in $N$; (m2) a morphism $t_a : ma \otimes n \ra m \otimes an$ for each \CDcomm{triple $(m,a,n)$ ... }.  These morphisms are subject to the two relations: (r1) for each \CDcomm{triple $(\phi, \epsilon, \psi)$}, the composite $ma \otimes n \ra m \otimes an \ra m' \otimes a' n'$ equals the composite $ma \otimes n \ra m' a' \otimes n' \ra m' \otimes a' n'$; (r2) the composite $(ma)b \otimes n \ra ma \otimes bn \ra m \otimes a(bn)$ equals the composite $(ma)b \otimes n \ra m(ab) \otimes n \ra m \otimes (ab)n \ra m \otimes a(bn)$.
\end{remark} % cf ENOII "Explicit description 1"



\begin{definition}
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be tensor categories, and let $\bimod{A}{M}{B}$ and $\bimod{B}{N}{C}$ be bimodules.  The composite bimodule $\bimod{A}{M \dtimes_B N}{C}$ is the idempotent completion of the precomposite bimodule:
\begin{equation} \nn
\bimod{A}{M \dtimes_B N}{C} := \IC \left( \bimod{A}{M \otimes_B N}{C} \right)
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\CDcomm{$\Vect \dtimes_{\Vect[\ZZ/2]} \Vect$ is $\Vect \oplus \Vect$, [cf ENOII "Example 1 (cont):"]}
\end{example}

%%%

\begin{proposition} \CD{Not sure whether we need this prop or where it best belongs.}
Let $A$ be a \CDcomm{...} monoidal indempotent complete linear category, and let $M$ and $N$ be $A$-modules.  If $N$ is idempotent complete, then $\Hom_A(M,N)$ is idempotent complete.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
For $A$ and $B$ tensor categories, and $M$ an $A$-$B$ bimodule, if $\bimod{A}{M}{B}$ has a right adjoint, then that right adjoint is $\bimod{B}{\Hom_A(M,A)}{A}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
\CDcomm{[Proof sketch of corollary at ENOII "Next steps on adjoints of 1-morphisms".]}
\end{proof}


\subsection{Multi-Fusion categories} \label{sec-tc-fusion}

\CD{CD continues to vote for using 'fusion' rather than 'multifusion'}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{fusion category} is a tensor category $\cC$ satisfying the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For all objects $a, b \in \cC$, the vector space $\Hom(a,b)$ is finite dimensional.
\item The category $\cC$ is semisimple, with finitely many simple objects.
\item For every object $a \in \cC$, there exists an object $\ld{a} \in \cC$ that is a left dual for $a$ and there exists an object $\rd{a} \in \cC$ that is a right dual for $a$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Here for brevity we use ``fusion category" to refer to what has elsewhere gone under the name ``multi-fusion category".
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
If $\cC$ is a fusion category, then there exist monoidal functors $\ld{(-)} : \cC \ra \cC^{\mop}$ and $\rd{(-)} : \cC \ra \cC^{\mop}$ whose values on any object $a \in \cC$ are respectively a left dual object $\ld{(a)}$ and a right dual object $\rd{(a)}$ for $a$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Define the functor $\ld{(-)}$ on objects by picking for each object $a \in \cC$ a left dual object $\ld{a} \in \cC$.  Also pick a unit map $u: \ld{a} \; a \ra 1$ and a counit map $v: 1 \ra a \; \ld{a}$ giving $\ld{a}$ the structure of a left dual to $a$.  Define the functor $\ld{(-)}$ on a morphism $f: a \ra b$ by $\ld{(f)} := (u_b \cdot \id_{\ld{a}}) (\id_{\ld{b}} \cdot f \cdot \id_{\ld{a}}) (\id_{\ld{b}} \cdot v_a)$.  (This morphism $\ld{(f)}$ is called the \emph{mate} of $F$.)  Next we want to see that this functor is monoidal.  Observe that the morphisms $\ld{b} \; \ld{a} \; a \; b \xra{u_a} \ld{b} \; b \xra{u_b} 1$ and $1 \xra{v_a} a \; \ld{a} \xra{v_b} a \; b \; \ld{b} \; \ld{a}$ show that $(\ld{b} \; \ld{a})$ is a left dual to $(a b)$.  There is therefore a uniquely determined isomorphism from $(\ld{b} \; \ld{a})$ to $\ld{(a b)}$.  These isomorphisms provide the left dual functor with a monoidal structure.  The right dual functor is analogous.  % In principle, need to check naturality and hexagon for those isos.
\end{proof}
% This fact is asserted in Bruce's thesis; the functor part is mentioned in Selinger Eg 4.4.

\begin{remark}
The monoidal functor $\ld{(-)}: \cC \ra \cC^{\mop}$ is an equivalence of tensor categories; the inverse functor is $\rd{(-)}: \cC^{\mop} \ra \cC$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
A fusion category $\cC$ is \emph{pivotal} if the double left dual functor $\ldd{(-)}: \cC \xra{\ld{(-)}} \cC^{\mop} \xra{\ld{(-)}} \cC$ is equivalent to the identity functor as a monoidal functor.
\end{definition}

In other words, a fusion category is pivotal if the left dual functor $\ld{(-)}: \cC \ra \cC^{\mop}$ and the right dual functor $\rd{(-)}: \cC \ra \cC^{\mop}$ are monoidally equivalent.


\section{The Symmetric Monoidal 3-Category of Tensor Categories}

\subsection{Generalities on Symmetric Monoidal $(\infty,3)$-Categories}

%In this section we describe the symmetric monoidal 3-category of tensor categories. 
There are several different theories of symmetric monoidal 3-category which one could select to describe the 3-category of tensor categories. We will employ the theory of iterated complete Segal spaces described by Clark Barwick, \CSP{Get reference. Possible a reference to Simpson's work too?} or more precisely the symmetric monoidal variant thereof. There are two combinatorial categories which play a fundamental role in this theory. These are the simplex category $\Delta$ and Segal's category $\Gamma$. We start with a brief review of these categories. 

\begin{definition}
	The category  $\Gamma$ has objects finite (unpointed, possibly empty) sets, and a morphism in $\Gamma$ from $A$ to $B$ consists of a function $f: A \to P(B)$, satisfying $f(x) \cap f(y) = \emptyset$ if $x \neq y$, where $P(B)$ denotes the power-set of $B$. 
\end{definition}

This category was introduced by Segal in \cite{Segal-Categories and Cohomology Theories}.  The opposite category $\Gamma^\textrm{op} \simeq Fin_*$ is the category of finite pointed sets. Let $(m) = \{ 1, 2, \dots, m\}$. For each element $a \in A$, there exists a canonical map $i_a: (1) \to A$, which is defined by setting $i_a(1) = \{a\} \subseteq A$. If $C$ is a category with finite products, then the category of commutative monoids in $C$ is equivalent to the category of functors $M:\Gamma^{op} \to C$ such that for all $A\in \Gamma$ the following {\em Segal map} is an isomorphism
\begin{equation*}
	\prod_{a \in A} i_a^*: M(A) \to \prod_{a \in A} M(1).
\end{equation*}
The case $A=\emptyset$ ensures that $M(\emptyset) = 1$, the terminal object of $C$. More generally the 2-category of symmetric monoidal categories is (weakly) equivalent to the 2-category of {\em strict} functors $\Gamma^{op} \to \Cat$ such that for each $A \in \Gamma$ the Segal maps are equivalences. 
\CSP{Find reference for this fact.}

\begin{definition}
	The simplex category $\Delta$ is a choice of skeleton of the category of finite non-empty totally ordered sets and order preserving maps. The objects of $\Delta$ are the ordered sets $[n] = \{ 0 < 1 < 2 < \cdots < n\}$. A {\em $k$-simplex} of $[n]$ is a strictly order preserving map $[k] \to [n]$. There are $ {n+1}\choose {k+1}$ such maps. $0$-simplices will be called {\em vertices} and $1$-simplices will be called {\em edges}. 
\end{definition}

This is the category of combinatorial simplices. The vertices of $[n]$ have a natural ordering induced from the ordering of $[n]$. Let $[m + n]$ denote the ordered concatenation of $[m]$ with $[n]$. We thus obtain the following commuting square,
\begin{equation} \label{Eqn:Segal-Co-Map}
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline = 0.75cm]
	\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$[0]$};
	\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$[m]$};
	\node (RT) at (2, 1.5) {$[n]$};
	\node (RB) at (2, 0) {$[m+n]$};
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$m$} (LB);
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$0$} (RT);
	\draw [->] (RT) -- node [right] {$$} (RB);
	\draw [->] (LB) -- node [below] {$$} (RB);
	%\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
	%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}
where $0: [0] \to [n]$ and $m: [0] \to [m]$ denote the first and last vertices, respectively. 


Let $C$ be a category. The category of {\em simplcial objects of $C$} is the functor category $Fun(\Delta^\textrm{op}, C) = sC$. We write $X_\bullet$ for such a functor, and $X_n$ denotes the value assigned $[n] \in \Delta$. A {\em category internal to $C$} is a simplicial object $X$, such that the diagrams induced by those in equation (\ref{Eqn:Segal-Co-Map}),
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$X_{m+n}$};
	\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$X_m$};
	\node (RT) at (2, 1.5) {$X_n$};
	\node (RB) at (2, 0) {$X_0$};
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$$} (LB);
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$$} (RT);
	\draw [->] (RT) -- node [right] {$$} (RB);
	\draw [->] (LB) -- node [below] {$$} (RB);
	%\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
	%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
are a pullback diagrams. For a general simplicial object $X$, these commuting squares will be called {\em Segal squares} and if they are pullback squares we will say that $X$ satisfies the {\em Segal condition}. Hence a category internal to $C$ is a simplicial object satisfying the Segal condition. 

This may be contrasted with the notion of a category enriched to $C$, which consists of a {\em set} of objects together with hom objects $Hom(x,y) \in C$ (as opposed to an object $X_0 \in C$ of objects). Under certain conditions these notions may be related. Recall that a category is {\em extensive} (or {\em infinitary extensive}) if it admits small coproducts and coproducts are disjoint and stable under pullback. If $C$ is an extensive category with a terminal object, then a category enriched in $C$ is merely an internal category $X$ in which the object $X_0$ is {\em discrete}, i.e. a coproduct of terminal objects. Examples of extensive categories with terminal objects include the categories of sets, any category of presheaves (or more generally any Grothendieck topos), the category of topological spaces, and the category of small categories. 

\begin{example}
	An ordinary (small) category is a category enriched in sets.
\end{example}

Thus a category $C$ may equivalently be regarded as simplical set $NC_\bullet$, called the {\em nerve of $C$}. The $n^\textrm{th}$ set is given by the formula
\begin{equation*}
	NC_n := \sqcup_{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n \in C_0} \hom_C(x_0, x_1) \times \hom_C(x_1, x_2) \times \cdots \times \hom_C(x_{n-1}, x_n).
\end{equation*}
Regarding an ordered set as a category, $C_n$ may be viewed as the set of functors from $[n]$ to $C$. 

\begin{example}
	A {\em strict 2-category} is a category enriched in categories.
\end{example}

Thus a strict 2-category may equivalently be regarded as a simplical object with values in $\Cat$, such that $X_0$ is a set (thought of as a discrete category), and such the the Segal squares are pullback squares. Since $X_0$ is a set, these pullbacks may be simultaneously regarded as pullbacks in the 1-category of categories and functors or as weak (or homotopy) pullbacks in the 2-category of categories, functors and natural transformations. If $X_0$ is allowed to be a general category, these two notions of pullback may differ. 

\begin{definition}
	Let $\sSet$ denote the category of simplicial sets. An {\em $n$-fold simplicial space} is a functor $X: (\Delta^\textrm{op})^{\times n} \to \sSet$. A {\em $\Gamma$-$n$-fold simplicial space} is a functor $X: \Gamma^\textrm{op} \times (\Delta^\textrm{op})^{\times n} \to \sSet$.
\end{definition}

The categories of $n$-fold simplicial spaces and $\Gamma$-$n$-fold simplicial spaces admit combinatorial model structures which give robust theories of $(\infty, n)$-categories and symmetric monoidal $(\infty, n)$-categories, respectively. This is the context in which the cobordism hypothesis has been proven and is the context in which we frame our results. The fibrant objects of these model categories are the so-called $n$-fold complete Segal spaces and symmetric monoidal $n$-fold complete Segal spaces, respectively (these later are sometimes called special $\Gamma$-$n$-fold complete Segal spaces).
These fibrant objects enjoy many desirable properties. For example, the weak equivalences between fibrant objects are precisely the levelwise weak equivalences. Also many related constructions, like the homotopy category of an $(\infty, n)$-category, have simple direct descriptions for these fibrant objects. 

On the other hand, many examples occurring { in nature} do not arise as $n$-fold complete Segal spaces or as symmetric monoidal $n$-fold complete Segal spaces. For example in \cite{Lurie}, the $(\infty, n)$-category of cobordisms is constructed as a $n$-fold Segal space which is {\em not} complete. There are a number classes of $n$-fold simplicial spaces which are intermediary between general $n$-fold simplicial spaces and the fibrant $n$-fold complete Segal spaces. For many purposes these intermediary objects are just as good as their fibrant replacement. One such intermediate notion is that of $n$-fold Segal category, and it is this intermediate notion to which we now turn. 
%\begin{definition}
%	An $n$-fold simplicial space $X$ is {\em essentially constant} if, when regarded as a functor $X: (\Delta^\textrm{op})^{\times n} \to h\textrm{-}(sSet)$, it is equivalent to a constant functor, where $h\textrm{-}(sSet)$ denotes the homotopy category of simplicial sets.  
%\end{definition}
%
We may regard any $n$-fold simplicial space as a simplicial object in $(n-1)$-fold simplicial spaces. A $0$-fold simplicial space is understood to be a simplicial set. 

\begin{definition}
	A $0$-fold simplicial space (i.e. a simplicial set) is a {\em $0$-fold Segal category} if it is a Kan complex. An $n$-fold simplicial space $X$, regarded as a simplicial object $X_\bullet$ in $(n-1)$-fold simplicial spaces is an {\em $n$-fold Segal category} if the following conditions are satisfied
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The $(n-1)$-fold simplicial space $X_0$ is constant and discrete.
			\item Each of the $(n-1)$-fold simplicial spaces $X_k$ is an $(n-1)$-fold Segal category.
			\item For every $m, k$, the Segal square,
			\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzpicture}
				\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$X_{m+n}$};
				\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$X_m$};
				\node (RT) at (2, 1.5) {$X_n$};
				\node (RB) at (2, 0) {$X_0$};
				\draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$$} (LB);
				\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$$} (RT);

				\draw [->] (LB) -- node [below] {$$} (RB);
				%\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
				%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
			\end{tikzpicture}
			\end{center}
			is a homotopy pull-back square of $(n-1)$-fold simplical spaces, computed with the $(\infty, n-1)$-model structure.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{definition}
This final condition requires some explanation. The Segal square must realize $X_{m+n}$ as the homotopy fiber product $X_m \times_{X_0}^h X_n$, and this homotopy fiber product must be computed in the $(\infty, n-1)$-category model structure on $(n-1)$-fold simplicial sets. Moreover $X_{m+n}$ may not be levelwise equivalent to this homotopy fiber product, but merely weakly equivalent in this model structure. Fortunately, we require that $X_0$ is a discrete $(n-1)$-fold simplcial space. In this case the homotopy fiber product simplifies and is merely the ordinary fiber product. Thus condition (3) is equivalent to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(3')] For every $m$ and $k$ the Segal map $X_{m+n} \to X_m \times_{X_0} X_n$ is an equivalence of $(n-1)$-fold Segal categories. 
\end{enumerate}

Moreover equivalences between $n$-fold Segal categories admit a fairly tractable inductive recognition principle. To describe this me must introduce a few auxiliary concepts. Let $X$ be an $n$-fold Segal category. Recall that $X_0$ is a constant discrete simplicial space, and so may be regarded as a set. We call the elements of $X_0$ objects of $X$. 
Inductively we will define three functorial constructions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For every pair of objects $a,b \in X_0$, an $(n-1)$-fold Segal category $Hom_X(a,b)$.
	\item A category $\mathit{h}X$, called the {\em homotopy category} of $X$.
	\item A set $\pi_0 X$, which is the set of isomorphism classes of objects of $\mathit{h}X$. 
\end{itemize}
Once we have these constructions, equivalences of $n$-fold Segal categories are easily recognized: they are precisely those maps $f:X \to Y$ of $n$-fold simplicial spaces which induce equivalences of homotopy categories $\mathit{h}f:\mathit{h}X \to \mathit{h}Y$ and which induce equivalences of $(n-1)$-fold Segal categories $Hom_X(a,b) \to Hom_Y(fa, fb)$ for every pair of objects $a,b \in X_0$. 

Given a pair objects $a,b \in X_0$ in an $n$-fold Segal category $X$, the $(n-1)$-fold Segal category $Hom_X(a,b)$ is defined to be the fiber over $(a,b) \in X_0 \times X_0$ of the map $(d_0, d_1): X_1 \to X_0 \times X_0$.  
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (LT) at (0, 1.5) {$Hom_X(a,b)$};
	\node (LB) at (0, 0) {$pt$};
	\node (RT) at (3, 1.5) {$X_1$};
	\node (RB) at (3, 0) {$X_0\times X_0$};
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [left] {$$} (LB);
	\draw [->] (LT) -- node [above] {$$} (RT);
	\draw [->] (RT) -- node [right] {$$} (RB);
	\draw [->] (LB) -- node [above] {$(a,b)$} (RB);
	\node at (0.5, 1) {$\ulcorner$};
	%\node at (1.5, 0.5) {$\lrcorner$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The homotopy category $\mathit{h}X$ has the same object set $X_0$, and the morphisms set between two objects is given as the set $Hom_{\mathit{h}X}(a,b) := \pi_0 Hom_X(a,b)$. For every triple of objects $a,b,c \in X_0$ we have a similar $(n-1)$-fold Segal category $Hom_X(a,b,c)$ which is defined as the fiber in $X_2$ over the point $(a,b,c)$ in $X_0 \times X_0 \times X_0$. Since $X$ is an $n$-fold Segal category we have induced maps of $(n-1)$-fold Segal categories,
\begin{equation*}
	Hom_X(a,b) \times Hom_X(b,c) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longleftarrow} Hom_X(a,b,c) \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} Hom_X(a,c).
\end{equation*}
Composition in $\mathit{h}X$ is given by the induced map of sets,
\begin{equation*}
	 Hom_{\mathit{h}X}(a,b) \times Hom_{\mathit{h}X}(b,c) \cong \pi_0 Hom_X(a,b,c)\to \pi_0 Hom_X(a,c) = Hom_{\mathit{h}X}(a,c).
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}
	If we regard a set as a constant simplicial space, then the nerve of a category $NC$ is a 1-fold Segal category. $NC_0 = \textrm{ob}\ C$ and the space $Hom_{NC}(a,b)$ are the sets $Hom_C(a,b)$. Moreover $hNC \cong C$ is isomorphic to the category $C$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	A strict 2-category $C$ may be regarded as a simplical object $C_\bullet$ in $\Cat$ whose $n^\textrm{th}$ category is given by the usual formula
	\begin{equation*}
		C_n := \sqcup_{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n \in C_0} \hom_C(x_0, x_1) \times \hom_C(x_1, x_2) \times \cdots \times \hom_C(x_{n-1}, x_n).
	\end{equation*}
	We obtain a 2-fold simplicial set by applying the nerve construction to each of these categories, which, by viewing a set as a discrete simplicial space, we regard as a 2-fold simplcial space $NC_{\bullet \bullet}$. Since $C_\bullet$ satisfies the Segal condition, one deduces that $NC_{\bullet \bullet}$ is a 2-fold Segal category. 
	\footnote{Alternatively, one may start with the simplicial category $C_\bullet$, as before and apply the {\em complete Segal space nerve} to each of the categories $C_n$. The $k^\text{th}$ space of this simplicial space $N^{CSS}_\bullet C_n$ is obtained by first constructing the functor category $Fun([k], C_n)$, then throwing away the non-invertible natural transformations, and finally applying the classifying space functor to the resulting groupoid. This alternative has the advantage that it produces a {\em complete} Segal space $N^{CSS} C_n$. However for our purposes these are equivalent constructions as the canonical map $N C_n \to N^{CSS} C_n$ is a weak equivalence in the complete Segal space model structure. 
	%[Cite the Joyal Teinery paper for the Quillen equivalence between Segal spaces and Quasi-categories]
	} We call the association $C \mapsto NC_{\bullet \bullet}$ the {\em 2-categorical nerve}. 
	\CSP{We should get a reference for this.}
\end{example}

%If the $n$-fold Segal spaces $X_k$ are fibrant, that is complete, then these problems disappear. Weak equivalences between fibrant objects are computed levelwise, as are homotopy fiber products. 

%Thus in general we are left with the embarrassing responsibility of computing the correct homotopy fiber product $X_m \times_{X_0}^h X_n$, and showing that the canonical map from $X_{m+n}$ is a weak equivalence of $(\infty, n-1)$-categories. Fortunately there is another subclass of $n$-fold Segal spaces for which these two operations are relatively easy to perform: The {\em $n$-fold Segal categories}.

\begin{definition}
%   A $0$-fold Segal category is a Kan complex. An {\em $n$-fold Segal category} is an $n$-fold Segal space which satisfies
%   \begin{enumerate}
%   	\item $X_0$ is discrete, and
%   	\item for each $n$, $X_n$ is an $(n-1)$-fold Segal category. 
%   \end{enumerate}
	A {\em symmetric monoidal 3-fold Segal category} (a.k.a. {\em special $\Gamma$-$n$-fold Segal category}) is a $\Gamma$-$n$-fold simplicial space $X$, which we view as a functor from $\Gamma^\textrm{op}$ to $n$-fold simplcial spaces, such that the following conditions are satisfied. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $X_A$ is an $n$-fold Segal category for each $A \in \Gamma$. 
		\item For each set $A \in \Gamma$ (possibly empty) the canonical map,
		\begin{equation*}
			\prod_{a \in A} i_a^*: X_A \to \prod_{a \in A} X_{(1)}
		\end{equation*}
		is an equivalence of $n$-fold Segal categories. %\CSP{Should we also add the $X_{(0)} = pt$? We get $X_{(0)} \simeq pt$ for free.}
	%	\item (optional) The previous axiom implies that $X_\emptyset \simeq pt$. We assert that $X_\emptyset = pt$. 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


%Thus the goal of this section is to describe $\TC$ as a functor $\Gamma^{\op} \times (\Delta^{\op})^{\times 3} \to \sSet$. This is done in two stages. First we construct a nerve functor from the category of strict 2-categories to 2-fold Segal categories. This reduces the construction of $\TC$ to constructing a functor (also denoted $\TC$) from $\Gamma^{\op} \times \Delta^{\op}$ to the category of strict 2-categories and strict functors. As a warm-up, we first describe a functor $\lincat$ from $\Gamma^{\op}$ to strict 2-categories which serves as a model for the symmetric monoidal 2-category of linear categories. The functor $\TC$ is a more elaborate variation on this construction. 

%We now describe how a strict 2-category gives rise to a 2-fold Segal category. This can be regarded as a 2-categorical nerve. %Later we will construct explicitly $TC$ as a simplicial object in the category of strict 2-categories. Applying the previous 2-categorical nerve yields a 3-fold simplcial space which is shown to be a 3-fold Segal category. A variation on these constructions yields the $\Gamma$-3-fold Segal space $TC$. 
%\begin{definition}
%	A strict 2-category is a category object $(C_1 \rightrightarrows C_0)$ in categories such that the category of objects $C_0$ is discrete (i.e. its only morphisms are identities). 
%\end{definition}
%A strict 2-category gives rise to a simplicial category 




\subsection{The symmetric monoidal 2-category of tensor categories} \label{sec-tc-threecat}


We now describe $\TC$ as a functor from $(\Gamma \times \Delta)^\textrm{op}$ to strict 2-categories. Let $A$ be a finite set and $[n]\in \Delta$. The strict 2-category $TC(A,n)$ will have objects which consist of collections of several tensor categories, bimodule categories, functors, and natural transformations which are required to satisfy a host of conditions. The 1- and 2-morphisms of $TC(A,n)$ will be defined similarly. Morally, one should regard $TC(A,n)$ as the 2-category consisting of $A$-tuples of length $n$ strings of composable bimodule categories. In other words, if one had a pre-existing notion of 3-category, then $TC(A,n)$ should be thought of as functors from the category $A \times [n]$ into the weak 3-category $TC$. 

The problem with implementing this straightforward idea is that one almost invariably fails to produce a functor from $(\Gamma \times \Delta)^\textrm{op}$ to a category. This is largely due to the fact that  composition of bimodule categories is only weakly defined. It is defined up to equivalence of bimdule categories which are in turn defined up to unique natural isomorphism, but this is not sufficient to obtain a {\em strict} functor on $(\Gamma \times \Delta)^\textrm{op}$. The solution is to enlarge $TC(A,n)$ to include choices of all the possible composites that one would need in order to obtain a strict functor to strict 2-categories. The resulting $TC(A,n)$ is what we now describe.

As we mentioned, the objects of $TC(A,n)$ are certain collections of tensor categories, bimodule categories, and their various maps. These collections are parametrized by the $k$-faces of $[n]$ and collections of disjoint subsets of $A$. We summarize the data of an object $X \in TC(A,n)$ in Table \ref{Table:ObjectOfTC}.

		$\varphi_{S,S'; ij}$ & A natural isomorphism of bilinear bimodule functors from $y_{S,S'; ij} \circ (F_{S; ij} \times F_{S';ij})$ to $F_{S \cup S'; ij} \circ x_{S, S'; ij}$. 
	\end{tabular}
	\label{Table:1MorOfTC}
\end{table}
This data is required to satisfy the following axioms:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $S = \emptyset$, the $F_S;ij$ and $\xi_{S;ijk}$ are identities. If either $S$ or $S'$ is equal to $\emptyset$, then $\varphi_{S,S';ij}$ is the canonical map.
	\item For every subset $S$ and every 3-simplex $ijk\ell$ ...
	\item For every pair of disjoint subsets $S, S'$ and every 2-simplex $ijk$, ...
	\item For every triple of disjoint subsets $S, S', S''$ and every edge $ij$, ...
\end{enumerate}
A 2-morphism between 1-morphisms $F$ and $G$ from $X$ to $Y$ consists of a collection of $\{ \theta_{S;ij} \}$ consisting of $X_{S;i}$-$X_{S;j}$-bimodule natural transformations from $F_{S;ij}$ to $G_{S;ij}$ for each subset $S \subseteq A$ and 2-simplex $ij$ in $[n]$. These are required to satisfy that $\theta_{\emptyset;ij}$ is the identity and the following pair of equations hold:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For each 2-simplex $ijk$, we have
	\begin{equation*}
		(\theta_{S; ik} * 1) \circ \xi^F_{S; ijk} = xi^G_{S;ijk} \circ (1 * (\theta_{S; ij} \times \theta_{S; jk})).
	\end{equation*}
	\item For each pair of disjoint subsets $S, S'$ we have
	\begin{equation*}
		(\theta_{S \cup S'; ij} * 1) \circ \varphi^F_{S, S'; ij} = \varphi^G_{S,S';ij} \circ (1*(\theta_{S;ij} \times \theta_{S';ij})).
	\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
With these as objects, 1-morphisms, and 2-morphisms, the obvious composition makes $TC(A,n)$ into a strict $2$-category. It is manifestly functorial in $A$ and $[n]$ and thus gives a (strict) functor 
\begin{equation*}
	\TC: \Gamma^\textrm{op} \times \Delta^\textrm{op} \to 2-\Cat.
\end{equation*}
into the 1-category of strict 2-categories. Composing with the coherent nerve for strict 2-categories gives us a $\Gamma$-3-fold simplicial space, which we also denote $\TC$.

\begin{theorem}
	 $\TC$ is a symmetric monoidal 3-fold Segal category.

%\CSP{This proposition is stated as a remark, without proof in Jacob's paper.}

\begin{proposition}[Lurie, Remark 3.4.22] \label{prop-ambiadjoints}
	Let $\cA$ be a symmetric monoidal 3-category. Let $f: x \to y$ be a 1-morphism in $\cA$, and suppose that $f$ admits a right adjoint $f^R$,  so we have unit and counit maps $u:id_x \to f^R \circ f$ and $v:f \circ f^R \to id_y$. If $u$ and $v$ admit left adjoints $u^L$ and $v^L$, then $u^L$ and $v^L$ exhibit $f^R$ also as a left adjoint to $f$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\CDcomm{[Should we include a proof?]} \CSPcomm{Of Course we should include a proof. Jacob omits one, so there is none in the literature, plus we need it as a substitute for the cob hypothesis for our applications to finite tensor cats.}

By assumption we are given 3-morphisms,
\begin{align*}
	\varepsilon_v: v^L \circ v & \Rightarrow id_{f \circ f^R} \\
	\eta_v: id_{id_y} & \Rightarrow v \circ v^L \\
	\varepsilon_u: u^L \circ u & \Rightarrow id_{id_x} \\
	\eta_u: id_{f^R \circ f} & \Rightarrow  u \circ u^L
\end{align*}
which satisfy the Zig-Zag identities:
\begin{align*}
	 id_v  &= (id_v * \varepsilon_v) \circ (\eta_v * id_v)  \\
	 id_{v^L}  &= (\varepsilon_v * id_{v^L} ) \circ (id_{v^L} * \eta_v)  \\
	 id_u  &= (id_u * \varepsilon_u) \circ (\eta_u * id_u)  \\
	 id_{u^L}  &= (\varepsilon_u * id_{u^L} ) \circ (id_{u^L} * \eta_u).  
\end{align*}
We must show that the following Zig-Zag identities hold:
\begin{align*}
	 (id_{f} * u^L) \circ (v^L * id_{f} ) & \cong id_{f} \\
 	 (u^L * id_{f^R}) \circ (id_{f^R} * v^L) & \cong id_{f^R} 
\end{align*}
By assumption we may also choose isomorphisms as follows:
\begin{align*}
	\alpha: id_f &\stackrel{\cong}{\to} (v * id_f) \circ (id_f * u) \\
	\beta: id_{f^R} &\stackrel{\cong}{\to} (id_{f^R} * v) \circ (u * id_{f^R} ).
\end{align*}
Then the required isomorphisms are given by the following composites:
\begin{align*}
	(id_{f} * u^L) \circ (v^L * id_{f} )
		& \cong id_f \circ (id_{f} * u^L) \circ (v^L * id_{f} ) \\
		& \stackrel{\alpha}{\cong} (v * id_f) \circ (id_f * u) \circ (id_{f} * u^L) \circ (v^L * id_{f} ) \\
		&  \stackrel{\varepsilon_u }{\Rightarrow} (v * id_f) \circ (v^L * id_{f} ) \\
		& \stackrel{\varepsilon_v }{\Rightarrow} id_{f},  \\
	(u^L * id_{f^R}) \circ (id_{f^R} * v^L) 
		& \cong  id_{f^R} \circ (u^L * id_{f^R}) \circ (id_{f^R} * v^L)  \\
		& \stackrel{\beta}{\cong}  (id_{f^R} * v) \circ (u * id_{f^R} )  \circ (u^L * id_{f^R}) \circ (id_{f^R} * v^L) \\
		& \stackrel{\varepsilon_u }{\Rightarrow} (id_{f^R} * v) \circ (id_{f^R} * v^L) \\
		& \stackrel{\varepsilon_v }{\Rightarrow} id_{f^R}.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

In particular, if you are in a situation where you happen to know a priori that the 2-morphisms $u$ and $v$ will have left adjoints, then you know that any adjoint to the 1-morphism $f$ will be ambidextrous.  % This proposition gets used in the Remark in the section computing the Serre automorphism.

\subsection{Structure groups of 3-manifolds} \label{sec-lft-struc}

\begin{definition}
An \emph{unstable structure} for $n$-dimensional vector bundles is a space $T$ together with a fibration $f: T \ra BO(n)$.  A $T$-structure on an n-dimensional vector bundle $V$ on $X$ is a lift of the classifying map $X \xra{V} BO(n)$ along $f$ to $T$.

A \emph{stable structure} is a space $S$ together with a fibration $f: S \ra BO$.  An $S$-structure on an n-dimensional vector bundle $V$ on $X$ is a lift of the composite map $X \xra{V} BO(n) \ra BO$ along $f$ to $S$.
\end{definition}
\CD{Are you happy with this def? Ie without mentioning the group structure on $G \ra O$?}

The discussion in this section records material that was utilized implicitly in the obstruction theory analysis of the first author with Bartels and Henriques~\cite{bdh}.
\CD{This sentence isn't an attempt to claim credit, but to give Andre the credit he deserves for helping sort this stuff out.  There might be a better way or spot to do it.}

%\subsubsection{Unstable structures}

We describe six unstable structures for 3-dimensional vector bundles, namely \emph{orientation}, \emph{spin structure}, \emph{orpo structure}, \emph{2-framing}, \emph{string structure}, and \emph{framing}.

\begin{definition}
The following six spaces, together with the obvious maps to $BO(3)$, define the aforementioned unstable bundle structures:
\begin{itemize}
\item[Or:] $BSO(3)$
\item[Spin:] $BSpin(3) := \hofib(BSO(3) \xra{w_2} K(\ZZ/2,2))$
\item[Orpo:] $BOrpo(3) := \hofib(BSO(3) \ra BSO \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4))$
\item[2-Frame:] $B\Omega(Spin(6)/SO(3))$
\item[String:] $BString(3) := \hofib(BSpin(3) \ra BSpin \xra{(p_1)/2} K(\ZZ,4))$
\item[Frame:] $*$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\nid In the definition of 2-Frame, the inclusion from $SO(3)$ to $Spin(6)$ is the canonical lift of the map $SO(3) \ra SO(6)$ sending $\phi$ to $\phi \oplus \phi$; hence the idea of framing twice the vector bundle, hence the name.

\begin{remark}
``Orpo structure" is short for ``oriented $p_1$ structure", and sometimes goes under the name ``$p_1$ structure" in the literature.  Note that there is, however, a structure group where only $p_1$ has been killed, rather than $w_1$ and $p_1$, and that structure is itself sometimes refered to as a ``$p_1$ structure".  We won't have need for those $p_1$ structures and so do not discuss them; similarly we omit versions of $Pin$ structures.
\end{remark}

Orpo structures and 2-framings are different; for instance, the set of homotopy classes of parametrized families of the two structures on a vector bundle can be genuinely distinct.  However, as far individual tangential structures on a single 3-manifold are concerned, they are homotopically indistinguishable---this convergence no doubt has contributed to some of the confusion in the literature.
\begin{proposition}
There is a homotopy equivalence between the 4-coconnected covers of $BOrpo(3)$ and $B\Omega(Spin(6)/SO(3))$.  In particular, for a closed 3-manifold $M$, there is a bijection between the tangential orpo structures and the tangential 2-framings on $M$.
\end{proposition}
\CD{I mean the space where you killed $\pi_4$ and up --- that's ``4-coconnected"?}
\CDcomm{[Is there a canonical map from $B\Omega(Spin(6)/SO(3))$ to $BOrpo(3)$ or vice versa? Ie is the composite $B\Omega (Spin(6)/SO(3)) \ra BSO(3) \ra BSO \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4)$ trivial?  Is the composite $BOrpo(3) \ra BSO(3) \ra BSpin(6)$ trivial?  If so, adjust the above discussion to reflecct this.  If not, leave as is.]}
\CD{I haven't (re)checked the k-invariant between $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$. We better do that.}
\CDcomm{[Ack, don't you need a 5-coconnected equivalence to get the bijection of tangential structures?  Or maybe you need a touch less than that.  Is it a 4- or 5-coconn equiv?  Maybe there is a more subtle reason why there is a bijection even if it isn't a 5-coconn equiv?]}

% Omit the proof.

Though the definition and analysis of these unstable structures on 3-dimensional vector bundles is elementary, there are potential pitfalls, so we record some information about them in rather pedantic detail.
\begin{proposition} \CD{Everything in this proposition should be carefully rechecked.}
.
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item
The homotopy groups $\pi_2$, $\pi_3$, $\pi_4$, and $\pi_5$ of the classifying spaces for the first five structure groups in question are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$BSO(3)$:] $\ZZ/2$, $0$, $\ZZ$, $\ZZ/2$
\item[$BSpin(3)$:] $0$, $0$, $\ZZ$, $\ZZ/2$
\item[$BOrpo(3)$:] $\ZZ/2$, $\ZZ/4$, $0$, $\ZZ/2$
\item[$Spin(6)/SO(3)$:] $\ZZ/2$, $\ZZ/4$, \CDcomm{$\ZZ/2$}, \CDcomm{?}
\item[$BString(3)$:] $0$, $0$, $0$, $\ZZ/2$
\end{itemize}
%
\item
The integral cohomology groups $H^3$, $H^4$, and $H^5$ of the stable and unstable orthogonal and spin classifying spaces are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$BSO(3)$:] $\ZZ/2$, $\ZZ$, $0$
\item[$BSpin(3)$:] $0$, $\ZZ$, $0$
\item[$BSO$:] $\ZZ/2$, $\ZZ$, $\ZZ/2$
\item[$BSpin$:] ...
\end{itemize}
%
\item 
On fourth integral cohomology, the maps among these classifying spaces are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$BSO(3) \ra BSO$:] \CDcomm{1}
\item[$BSpin(3) \ra BSO(3)$:] ...
\item[$BSpin \ra BSO$:] ...
\item[$BSpin(3) \ra BSpin$:] ...
\end{itemize}
As a result, the generator of $H^4(BSO(3);\ZZ)$ is $p_1/...$ and the generator of $H^4(BSpin(3);\ZZ)$ is $p_1/...$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\CDcomm{[In all this, the following weird fact (recheck) is relevant: $\pi_4(BSO(3) \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4)) = 4$, even though $p_1$ is a generator of $H^4(BSO(3);\ZZ)$.]}

\CDcomm{[This point of this proposition is to see what the generators of $H^4$ of $BSO(3)$ and $BSpin(3)$ are, since those determine the options for the unstable structure groups.]}

%\subsubsection{Stable structures}

Though in dimension 3 all the natural stable structures are equivalent, at least in unparametrized homotopy, to unstable structures, it is nevertheless worth mentioning them.  We describe the structures \emph{stable orientation}, \emph{stable spin structure}, \emph{stable orpo structure}, \emph{stable string structure}, and \emph{stably framed structure}.

\begin{definition}
The following five spaces, together with the obvious maps to $BO$, define the aforementioned stable bundle structures:
\begin{itemize}
\item[StOr:] $BSO$
\item[StSpin:] $BSpin$
\item[StOrpo:] $\hofib(BSO \xra{p_1} K(\ZZ,4))$
\item[StString:] $\hofib(BSpin \xra{(p_1)/2} K(\ZZ,4))$
\item[StFrame:] $*$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\nid Note that for $X \in \{\Or, \Spin, \Orpo, \String\}$, a stable $X$ structure on a 3-dimensional vector bundle is exactly the same as an $X$ structure on a 3-dimensional vector bundle, because $BX(3)$ is by construction the homotopy pullback of $BO(3) \ra BO \la BX$.  This is not, however, the case for $X = \Frame$; indeed there is a substantial difference between a framing and a stable framing.  Nevertheless, as far as individual tangential structures on 3-manifolds are concerned, there is a homotopical coincidence between stably framed structures and stable string structures, therefore between stably framed structures and string structures.
\begin{proposition}
For $M$ a 3-manifold, the natural forgetful map from stably framed structures to stable string structures induces a bijection between the set of homotopy classes of stable framings on $M$ to the set of homotopy classes of stable string structures on $M$.
\end{proposition}



\section{Dualizability and tensor categories} \label{sec-dualfusion}


\subsection{Adjoints of bimodule functors} \label{sec-df-functors}

In this section we give sufficient conditions for a $\cC$--$\cD$ bimodule functor $\cF: \cM \rightarrow \cN$ to have a left adjoint and a right adjoint.  In particular, we show that any module functor between semisimple module categories over fusion categories has adjoints.

\begin{lemma} \label{module-adjoint}
Let $\cC, \cD \in \TCrig$, let $\cM, \cN \in \Hom_\TCrig(\cC,\cD)$, and let $\cF \in \Hom_{\TCrig}(\cM,\cN)$.  If the underlying functor $\cF$ has a right (or left) adjoint as a functor, then $\cF$ has a right (resp. left) adjoint in $\Hom_{\TCrig}(\cN,\cM)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $\cG$ is the right adjoint to $\cF$, we will show that $\cG$ has a natural structure of a $\cC\boxtimes \cD^{mp}$-module category.  The result for left adjoints is similar.

The binatural transformation $\psi_{x,n}: x \otimes \cG(n) \rightarrow \cG(x \otimes n)$ is given by
$$x \otimes \cG(n) \rightarrow \cG \cF(x \otimes \cG(n)) \rightarrow \cG(x \otimes \cF\cG(n)) \rightarrow \cG(x \otimes n)$$
where the first map is the unit of the adjunction, the second map is the binatural transformation coming from the module functor structure on $\cF$ and the third map is the counit.  Rigidity of $\cC$ and $\cD$ guarantees that this binatural transformation is an isomorphism.  The compatibility condition is an easy exercise with commuting diagrams.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
If $\cC$ and $\cD$ are not rigid the above argument only shows that the right adjoint to a lax module functor has an oplax module functor structure, while the left adjoint of an oplax module functor has a lax module functor structure.  
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
If $\cC$ and $\cD$ are finite abelian categories and $\cF: \cC \rightarrow \cD$ is a left exact functor, then $\cF$ has a right adjoint.  If $\cF$ is right exact then it has a left adjoint functor.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
If $\cB$ is a finite tensor category and $\cM$ and $\cN$ are module categories over $\cB$ with $\cM$ exact, then any module category functor $\cF:\cM \rightarrow \cN$ is exact.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
Let $\cC, \cD \in \TCrig$, let $\cM, \cN \in \Hom_\TCrig(\cC,\cD)$, and let $\cF \in \Hom_{\TCrig}(\cM,\cN)$.  Suppose that $\cB$ is an auxiliary finite tensor category, that $\cM$ and $\cN$ are $\cB$ module categories, and that the underlying functor $\cF$ can be given the structure of a $\cB$ module category.  If $\cM$ is exact as a $\cB$ module category, then $\cF$ has both a left adjoint functor and a right adjoint functor in $\Hom_{\TCrig}(\cN,\cM)$.  
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Exactness of $\cM$ as a $\cB$ module guarantees that the underlying functor of $\cF$ is exact and thus has both left and right adjoints as a functor.  Then Lemma \ref{module-adjoint} shows that it has left and right adjoints as a $\cC$--$\cD$ bimodule functor.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
In applications of the above corollary $\cB$ will typically be $\mathrm{Vec}$, $\cC$, $\cD^{mp}$, or $\cC \boxtimes \cD^{mp}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}
Any $2$-morphism in $\TCss$ has a left adjoint and a right adjoint in $\TCss$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Apply the above corollary with $\cB = \mathrm{Vec}$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Adjoints of bimodules}  \label{sec-df-modules}

In this section we give sufficient conditions for a $\cC$--$\cD$ bimodule category $\cM$ to have left and right adjoints.  In particular, if $\cC$ and $\cD$ are finite tensor categories, and their action on $\cM$ is left exact, then $\cM$ has both a left and a right adjoint.  Explicitly, the right adjoint of of $\cM$ is the category of left exact left module functors $\Fun_{\cC\text{-mod}}(\cM, \cC)$ where the left $\cD$ action is given by precomposition by right multiplication, and the right $\cC$ action is given by postcomposition by right multiplication.  Similarly, the left adjoint is given by the category of left exact right module functors $\Fun_{\text{mod}-\cD}(\cM, \cD)$.  The key assumptions in this section are finiteness of the categories and left exactness of the module actions.

\begin{lemma}
The map $\ev: \Fun_{\text{mod}-\cD}(\cM, \cD) \boxtimes_{\cC} \cM \rightarrow \cD$ induced by the $\cC$-balanced bifunctor $(f,m) \mapsto f(m)$ is an equivalence of $\cD$--$\cD$ bimodule categories.  Similarly, $\ev: \cM \boxtimes_{\cD} \Fun_{\cC\text{-mod}}(\cM, \cC) \rightarrow \cC$ is an equivalence of $\cC$--$\cC$ bimodule categories.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

The maps $\ev$ give the counits of the adjunctions.  The units of the adjunctions are more delicate, since it is more difficult to describe maps out of a tensor product than maps into a tensor product.  In order to describe the units we first give an alternate description of the tensor product as a category of functors.


\begin{lemma}
The map $\Fun_{\cC\text{-mod}}(\cM,\cC) \boxtimes_\cC \cM \rightarrow \Fun_{\cC\text{-mod}}(\cM,\cM)$ induced by $(f,m) \mapsto (x \mapsto f(x)m)$ is an equivalence of $\cD$--$\cD$ bimodules.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
The map $\coev: \cD \rightarrow \Fun_{\cC\text{-mod}}(\cM,\cM) \cong \Fun_{\cC\text{-mod}}(\cM,\cC) \boxtimes_\cC \cM$ sending $d$ to right multiplication by $d$ is a map of $\cD$--$\cD$ bimodules.  Similarly, the map $\coev: \cC \rightarrow \Fun_{\text{mod}-\cD}(\cM,\cM) \cong \Fun_{\text{mod}-\cD}(\cM,\cD) \boxtimes_\cD \cM$ sending $c$ to left multiplication by $c$ is a map of $\cC$--$\cC$ bimodules.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
$\ev$ and $\coev$ are the unit and counit of an adjunction.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}


It will sometimes be convenient to have an alternative description of the left and right adjoints to $\cM$.

\begin{lemma}
Let ${}^*\cM$ denote the $\cD$--$\cC$ bimodule category whose underlying category is $\cM^{\op}$ and the action is given by $d\cdot m \cdot c = {}^*c \otimes m \otimes {}^*d$.  Similarly, let Let $\cM^*$ denote the $\cD$--$\cC$ bimodule category whose underlying category is $\cM^{\op}$ and the action is given by $d\cdot m \cdot c = c^* \otimes m \otimes d^*$.  We have that ${}^*\cM \cong \Fun_{\text{mod}-\cD}(\cM, \cD)$ and $\cM^* \cong \Fun_{\cC\text{-mod}}(\cM, \cC)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The isomorphism ${}^*\cM \rightarrow \Fun_{\text{mod}-\cD}(\cM, \cD)$ is given by the internal Hom, namely $m \mapsto \underline{\Hom}(m, \bullet)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Combining Lemmas ??? we have  $\cM^* \boxtimes_\cC \cM \rightarrow \Fun_{\cC\text{-mod}}(\cM,\cM)$.  This is Lemma ??? from \cite{???}, but the reader should be warned that the result stated in that paper is not correct for bimodule categories. 
\end{remark}

\subsection{Duals of objects} \label{sec-df-objects}

In this section we show that $\cC^\mp$ is the dual of $\cC$.  Explicitly the unit is $\cC$ as a $\mathrm{Vec}$--$\cC^\mp \boxtimes \cC$ bimodule with the obvious actions, and the counit is $\cC$ as a $\cC^\mp \boxtimes \cC$--$\mathrm{Vec}$ bimodule.

\subsection{Fusion categories are fully dualizable}

\begin{theorem}
The $3$-category $\TCss$ is fully dualizable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This follows immediately from Lemmas ???.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
If $\cC$ is a multi-fusion category with non-zero global dimension then there exists a fully extended $3$-dimensional $3$-framed TFT which sends the positively framed point to $\cC$, furthermore up to isomorphism there is exactly one such TFT.
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}
It is worth noting that we have not assumed that the base field is algebraically closed.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Dualizability and finite tensor categories}

\begin{theorem}
The $(3,2)$ category gotten from $\TCrig$ by discarding all noninvertible $3$-morphisms is fully dualizable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This follows immediately from Lemmas ???
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
If $\cC$ is a finite multi-tensor category, then there exists a fully extended categorified $2$-framed $2$-dimensional TFT which sends the positively framed point to $\cC$, furthermore up to isomorphism there is exactly one such TFT.
\end{corollary}

In fact, we can do better.  As we will see in the next section, there is a canonical lifting of this TFT to a $3$-framed $2$-dimensional TFT.  Even better, we actually can define the value of the TFT on certain non-invertible $3$-morphisms.

\begin{definition}
Let $Bord_3^{\text{nc}}$ be the $3$-category where we only allow $3$-dimensional bordisms where every connected component has nonempty intersection with the source.  As with the usual bordism category this comes in different topological flavors (oriented, $3$-framed, etc.).  A noncompact fully extended TFT is a symmetric monoidal functor from $Bord_3^{\text{nc}}$ to another symmetric monoidal $3$-category.
\end{definition}

\section{The Serre automorphism of a fusion category} \label{sec-serre}


\CDcomm{(1a) Any fusion category is dualizable; (1b) any dualizable category has a Serre automorphism; (2) any fusion category has a monoidal functor $*: \cC \ra \cC^{\op}$.  Therefore for any fusion category it makes sense to compare the Serre bimodule and the bimodule associated to the tensor functor $** : \cC \ra \cC$.}


\subsection{The double dual is the Serre automorphism} \label{sec-serre-dd}



\subsubsection{n-framed 1-manifolds and the Serre automorphism} \label{sec-serre-oneman}

Recall that an n-framed k-manifold $(M,\tau)$ is a k-manifold $M$ equipped with a trivialization $\tau$ of $TM \oplus \RR^{n-k}$.  For $m < n$, an m-framed k-manifold $(M,\tau)$ is naturally n-framed by the trivialization $\tau \oplus \gamma$ where $\gamma$ is the canonical trivialization of $\RR^{n-m}$.  A convenient way to encode $(k+1)$-framed k-manifolds is as normally-oriented immersed k-manifolds in $\RR^{k+1}$.  That is, given an immersion $i: M^k \lra \RR^{k+1}$, the sum $TM \oplus \nu(M,\RR^{k+1})$ of the tangent and normal bundles is canonically trivialized, and a normal orientation for the immersion trivializes $\nu(M,\RR^{k+1})$, providing a trivialization of $TM \oplus \RR$ as desired.  More generally, by the same reasoning any coframed immersed k-manifold in $\RR^n$ is naturally n-framed.

We now define the Serre automorphism.  We presume $n \geq 2$ throughout.  For any point $p \in \RR^n$ we can equip the embedding $p \hra \RR^n$ with the canonical coframing, therefore n-framing.  We refer to such a point as the standard positively-oriented point---it is an object of $\FrBord_0^n$, and we denote it by $s$.  Consider the normally-oriented immersed 1-manifold $\cS \lra \RR^2$ in Figure~\ref{fig-serre}.  This manifold is 2-framed, therefore n-framed for any $n \geq 2$.  It can be viewed as a morphism in $\FrBord_0^n$ from $s$ to $s$.  This automorphism is called the \emph{universal Serre automorphism}.

When $n \geq 3$, the universal Serre automorphism $\cS: s \ra s$ in $\FrBord_0^n$ is an involution; that is, $\cS \circ \cS : s \ra s$ is equivalent to the identity automorphism.
\end{proposition}

\CDcomm{[Just draw the bordisms back and forth and indicate the bordism from the two composites to the identity? Is there a clear way to say what those bordisms of 2-manifolds immersed in $\RR^3$ are?]}
\end{proof}
%This can be seen by observing that there is a normally-oriented immersed bordism in $\RR^3$ from the square of the Serre 1-manifold to the trivial 1-manifold.

Whenever $a$ is a dualizable object in a symmetric monoidal n-category $\cA$, there is a functor $\cF_a: \FrBord_0^n \ra \cA$ taking the standard positively-oriented point to $a$.  The image of the universal Serre automorphism under this functor is called the Serre automorphism of $a$ and is denoted $\cS_a : a \ra a$.  This automorphism is again an involution.

\begin{corollary} \label{cor-serreinvol}
Let $a$ be a dualizable object of a symmetric monoidal n-category $\cA$.  Provided $n \geq 3$, the square $\cS_a^2 : a \ra a$ of the Serre automorphism $\cS_a$ of $a$ is equivalent to the identity of $a$.
\end{corollary}

\subsubsection{Computing the Serre automorphism} \label{sec-serre-comp}


For $a \in \cA$ be a dualizable object of a symmetric monoidal n-category, let $\ev : a \otimes a^{\vee} \ra 1$ and $\coev: 1 \ra a^{\vee} \otimes a$ denote the evaluation and coevaluation maps for the duality between $a \in \cA$ and its dual object $a^{\vee} \in \cA$.  Let $\rd{\ev}: 1 \ra a \otimes a^{\vee}$ be the right adjoint to $\ev$ and let $\ld{\coev}: a^{\vee} \otimes a \ra 1$ be the left adjoint to $\coev$.  Let $\tau: a \otimes a \ra a \otimes a$ denote the symmetric monoidal switch.

\begin{proposition} \label{prop-serrecomp}
Let $a \in \cA$ be a dualizable object of the symmetric monoidal n-category $\cA$, for $n \geq 2$.  The Serre automorphism $\cS_a : a \ra a$ is equivalent to both of the following composites:
\begin{align}
\cS_a & \simeq (\id_a \otimes \rd{\ev}) (\tau \otimes \id_{a^{\vee}}) (\id_a \otimes \ev) \nn\\
\cS_a & \simeq (\coev \otimes \id_a) (\id_{a^{\vee}} \otimes \tau) (\ld{\coev} \otimes \id_a) \nn
\end{align}
\end{proposition}
\CD{the composition order here is geometric}

The expressions given hold in the universal case of framed bordism, and we leave the proof as an excercise in adjunctions of 2-framed 1-manifolds.

\begin{remark}
If $n \geq 3$, then the adjunctions of 1-morphisms are ambidextrous, and so the equations for the Serre automorphism given in the proposition could as well have used $\ld{\ev}$ and $\rd{\coev}$ instead.
\end{remark}

%%%

We now specialize to our case of interest, namely where the dualizable object in question is a fusion category $\cC \in \TC$.

%\CD{Where did we establish that $Hom_D(M,D)$ is a left/right adjoint to M, etc, and under what conditions? --- the identification of Serre depended on this!}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm-serre}
If $\cC$ is a fusion category, then the Serre bimodule $\bimod{\cC}{\cS}{\cC}$ for $\cC$ is Morita equivalent to the $\cC$--$\cC$ bimodule associated to the left double dual monoidal functor $\ldd{(-)}: \cC \ra \cC$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

%Recall that the evaluation and coevaluation of the duality between $\cC$ and $\cC^{\mp}$ are the bimodules $\ev_{\cC} = \bimod{\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}}{\cC}{\Vect}$ and $\coev_{\cC} = \bimod{\Vect}{\cC}{\cC^{\mp} \otimes \cC}$.  By Theorem~\ref{thm-indecompbraided} and Proposition~\ref{prop-moduleadj}, these bimodules have adjoints, namely $\rd{\ev} = \bimod{\Vect}{\Hom_{(\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp})-\mod}(\cC,\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp})}{\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}}$ and $\ld{\coev} = \bimod{\cC^{\mp} \otimes \cC}{\Hom_{\mod-(\cC^{\mp} \otimes \cC)}(\cC,\cC^{\mp} \otimes \cC)}{\Vect}$.

Recall that the evaluation of the duality between $\cC$ and $\cC^{\mp}$ is the bimodule $\ev_{\cC} = \bimod{\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}}{\cC}{\Vect}$.  By Theorem~\ref{thm-indecompbraided} and Proposition~\ref{prop-moduleadj}, this bimodule has an adjoint, namely $\rd{\ev} = \bimod{\Vect}{\Hom_{\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}}(\cC,\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp})}{\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}}$.  By Proposition~\ref{prop-serrecomp}, the Serre bimodule $\bimod{\cC}{\cS}{\cC}$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation} \nn
\cS \simeq (\cC \otimes \Hom_{\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}}(\cC,\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp})) \dtimes_{\cC \otimes \cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}} (\cC \otimes \cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}) \dtimes_{\cC \otimes \cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}} (\cC \otimes \cC)
\end{equation}
which can be compacted into the expression
\begin{equation} \nn
\cS \simeq (\cC \otimes \Hom_{\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}}(\cC,\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp})) \dtimes_{\cC \otimes \cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}} (\cC \otimes \cC)
\end{equation}
where the $\cC \otimes \cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}$ action on $(\cC \otimes \Hom_{\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}}(\cC,\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}))$ is the tensor of the expected right actions, but the $\cC \otimes \cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}$ action on $(\cC \otimes \cC)$ is given by switching the two $\cC$ factors of $\cC \otimes \cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}$ and then acting by the tensor of the expected left actions.

The bimodule associated to the double dual functor $\ldd{(-)}: \cC \ra \cC$ can be written as $\bimod{\cC}{\cD}{\cC} := \bimod{\cC}{\cC \dtimes_{\cC} \cC}{\cC}$; here the $\cC$--$\cC$ bimodule structure on ${\cC \dtimes_{\cC} \cC}$ is standard, and the tensor $\dtimes_{\cC}$ occurs with respect to the standard right action of $\cC$ on $\cC$ and with respect to the \emph{right} double dual left action of $\cC$ on $\cC$, that is the left action induced by the functor $\rd{(-)}: \cC \ra \cC$.

As the double dual bimodule is cyclic, the equivalence between the double dual bimodule and the Serre bimodule can be specified by its value on the unit:
\begin{align}
\cC \dtimes_{\cC} \cC 
& \xra{\phi} 
(\cC \otimes \Hom_{\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}}(\cC, \cC \otimes \cC^{\mp})) \dtimes_{\cC \otimes \cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}} (\cC \otimes \cC) 
\nn\\
1 \dtimes 1 
& \mapsto 
(1 \otimes (1 \mapsto \sum_{\sigma \in \cI} (\sigma \otimes \ld{\sigma}))) \dtimes (1 \otimes 1)
\nn
\end{align}
As before, $\cI$ indexes the simple objects of $\cC$.  To check that this map is well defined, we need to know, since $a \otimes 1 \simeq 1 \otimes \ldd{a} \in \cC \dtimes_{\cC} \cC$, that $a \phi(1 \otimes 1) \simeq \phi(1 \otimes 1) \ldd{a}$.  \CDcomm{[Recheck the rest of this proof and add more explanation if necessary.]}  This is true provided $\sum_{\sigma \in \cI} \sigma \otimes a \; \ld{\sigma} \simeq \sum \sigma \; \ldd{a} \otimes \ld{\sigma}$.  That equivalence holds because of the isomorphism of structure constants,
\begin{equation} \nn
N^{\ld{\tau}}_{a, \ld{\sigma}} = N^{\ldd{\sigma}}_{\ldd{\tau}, a} = N^{\sigma}_{\tau, \ldd{a}}
\end{equation}
\CDcomm{[Comment about why this map is an equivalence.]}

\CD{The proof is slightly sketchy on the distinction between equality and iso and how much naturality is needed of the isos.}


\end{proof}

%!% \CDcomm{Comment: The above proof uses the expression for the adjoint that is Hom over $\cC \otimes \cC^{\mp}$.  I did it this way because the proofs in section 4 produce that as the adjoint.  However, we know, I think, that when an adjoint exists, the adjoint is also equal to $Hom_{\Vect}(\cC,\Vect)$---see ENOII "Next steps on adjoints", though that is written for right adjoints, so would show that the $\Vect$-Hom is an adjoint for the coevaluation.  In any case, we could instead have explained why the $\Vect$-Hom is also an adjoint, and then used that expression to calculate Serre.  The calculation of Serre is probably more straightforward then, as some of the fiddling has been moved into comparing the two adjoint expressions.  At a minimum, we should probably add a remark, attempted below.}

\begin{remark}
The Serre automorphism of a fusion category can be identified with the double dual in a slightly different way, as follows.  Observe that $\Hom_{(\Vect)-\mathrm{mod}}(\cC,\Vect)$ is a right adjoint to the coevaluation bimodule $\coev_{\cC} = \bimod{\Vect}{\cC}{\cC^{\mp} \otimes \cC}$.  \CDcomm{[sentence or more explaning why, or perhaps this fact will be a proposition earlier in the paper]}  

Both the coevaluation bimodule $\coev_{\cC}$ and its right adjoint $\Hom_{(\Vect)-\mathrm{mod}}(\cC,\Vect)$ are semisimple with finitely many simple objects.  By Proposition~\ref{prop-functadj}, both the unit and counit of the adjunction between them will have left adjoints.  Proposition~\ref{prop-ambiadjoints} therefore ensures that $\Hom_{(\Vect)-\mathrm{mod}}(\cC,\Vect)$ is also a left adjoint to $\coev_{\cC}$, and so can be used in the second expression for the Serre automorphism given in Proposition~\ref{prop-serrecomp}.  This gives the equivalence
\begin{equation} \nn
\cS \simeq (\cC \otimes \cC) \dtimes_{\cC^{\mp} \otimes \cC \otimes \cC} (\Hom_{(\Vect)-\mathrm{mod}}(\cC,\Vect) \otimes \cC)
\end{equation}
Here the left action of $\cC^{\mp} \otimes \cC \otimes \cC$ is the expected one, but the right action is twisted by switching the two $\cC$ factors.  As before let $\cD = \cC \dtimes_{\cC} \cC$ be the double dual bimodule, where the right action of $\cC$ on $\cC$ is standard, but the left action of $\cC$ on $\cC$ is via the right double dual functor.  

Now define an equivalence between the Serre bimodule $\cS$ and the double dual bimodule $\cD$, as follows:
\begin{align}
(\cC \otimes \cC) \dtimes_{\cC^{\mp} \otimes \cC \otimes \cC} (\Hom(\cC,\Vect) \otimes \cC) & \ra \cC \dtimes_{\cC} \cC \nn\\
(m, n) \dtimes (e_p, q) & \mapsto (n \rd{p}, mq)
\end{align}
Here $e_p \in \Hom(\cC,\Vect)$ is defined by $e_p(r) = \Hom(p,r)$.  As in the above proof, you need to check that this map is well defined, and that it is an equivalence.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Fusion category TFTs are string} \label{sec-pivot-string}

\begin{proposition} \label{prop-string}
Every framed local field theory $\cF : \FrBord_0^3 \ra \TC$ with target tensor categories descends to a string local field theory $\overline{\cF} : \StrBord_0^3 \ra \TC$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
This result is a direct analog of the corresponding result for conformal-net-valued local field theories, given in~\cite{bdh-lft}, and the proof is the same.  We briefly recall the structure of that proof.  \CDcomm{[Brief summary of argument.  Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence.]}
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}

\subsection{Pivotal fusion category TFTs are orpo} \label{sec-pivot-orpo}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm-pivorpo}
A fusion category $\cC \in \TC$ is pivotal if and only if the framed local field theory $\cF_{\cC} : \FrBord_0^3 \ra \TC$ associated to $\cC$ descends to an oriented-$p_1$ local field theory $\overline{\cF}_{\cC} : \OrpoBord_0^3 \ra \TC$.
\end{theorem}

\CDcomm{For pivotal $\Rightarrow$ orpo: use first the result from the last section getting to String, then use pivotal to get from string to orpo [need to know that trivializing Serre is enough].}

\end{proof}


\subsection{Structure groups of fusion category TFTs} \label{sec-pivot-struc}


In light of Theorem~\ref{thm-pivorpo}, the ENO conjecture, that fusion categories are pivotal, can be reformulated as follows:
\begin{conjecture}
Every framed local field theory with values in tensor categories descends to an oriented-$p_1$ local field theory.
\end{conjecture}
This formulation means that it is possible to approach the ENO conjecture both with geometric and obstruction-theoretic techniques.

Perhaps surprisingly, even more may be true:
\begin{conjecture}
Every oriented-$p_1$ local field theory with values in tensor categories descends to an oriented local field theory.
\end{conjecture}
\CD{Do we think we can prove this or should we leave it as a conjecture?}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
Drinfeld centers of pivotal fusion categories are anomaly free modular (ref Mueger), therefore oriented 123; pushout to show oriented as 0123.

\section{CSP's dustbin}

Let $A$ be a finite set. We define a strict 2-category $\lincat(A)$ as follows. Let $P(A)$ denote the powerset of $A$, and let $S$, $S'$, and $S''$ denote various disjoint subsets of $A$. The objects of $\lincat(A)$ consist of  $P(A)$-tuples of objects in $\lincat$, together with some additional data. Thus we have a finite linear category $X(S)$ for each subset $S \subseteq A$. The additional data consists of bilinear functors
\begin{align*}
		x_{S,S'}: & \; X(S) \times X(S') \to X(S \sqcup S') \\
		I: & \; \Vect \to X(\emptyset)
\end{align*}
and natural isomorphisms of multi-linear functors
\begin{align*}
		\alpha_{S, S', S''}:  & \; x_{S \sqcup S', S''}\circ (x_{S,S'} \times 1) \cong x_{S, S' \sqcup S''} \circ (1 \times x_{S', S''}) \\
		r_S: & \; x_{S, \emptyset} \circ (1 \times I)  \cong  \textrm{can}^r \\
		\ell_{S}: & \; x_{ \emptyset, S} \circ (I \times 1)  \cong  \textrm{can}^\ell
\end{align*}
where $\textrm{can}^r: X(S) \times \Vect \to X(S)$ is the canonical bilinear functor, and similarly for $\textrm{can}^\ell$. 
Moreover this data is subject to the following conditions: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $x_{S,S'}$ realizes $X(S \sqcup S')$ as the Deligne tensor product  $X(S) \boxtimes X(S') $, and $I$ is an isomorphism of linear categories. 
	\item $	\alpha_{S, S', S''}$ satisfies the evident pentagon identity. 
	\item $\ell_S$, $r_S$, and $\alpha_{\emptyset, S, \emptyset}$ satisfy the evident triangle identity.
\end{enumerate}

A morphism $f:X \to Y$ in $\lincat(A)$ consists of a $P(A)$-tuple of linear functors $f_S: X(S) \to Y(S)$, together with natural isomorphisms of bilinear functors $\phi_{S,S'}: y_{S,S'} \circ f_S \times f_{S'} \cong f_{S \sqcup S'} \circ x_{S,S'}$. For each triple $S$, $S'$, $S''$ of disjoint subset of $A$, the following hexagon identity holds,
\begin{equation*}
	[1 * \alpha^X_{S, S', S''}] \circ [\phi_{S \sqcup S', S''} * 1] \circ [1 *(\phi_{S, S'} \times 1)] = 
		[\phi_{S, S' \sqcup S''} * 1] \circ [1 * (1 \times \phi_{S', S''})] \circ [\alpha^Y_{S,S', S''} * 1].
\end{equation*}

A 2-morphism $\theta: f \to g$ in $\lincat(A)$ consists of a $P(A)$-tuple of linear natural transformations $\theta_S: f_S \to g_S$, such that for every pair of disjoint subsets $S$, $S'$ of $A$ the following identity holds: 
\begin{equation*}
	(\theta_{S\sqcup S'}* 1) \circ \phi^f_{S,S'} = \phi^g_{S,S'} \circ (1 * (\theta_S \times \theta_{S'})).
\end{equation*}

One readily verifies that $\lincat(A) \simeq \lincat^{\times A}$. Thus an object of $\lincat(A)$ can roughly be thought of as consisting of an $A$-tuple of linear categories. However the object of $\lincat(A)$ also includes choices of representatives for the possible Deligne tensor products of these linear categories. The assignment $A \mapsto \lincat(A)$ gives a strict functor from $\Gamma^\op \simeq \Fin_*$ to strict 2-categories, which by abuse of notation we will also denote by $\lincat$. 





\CSPcomm{

	\item levelwise $\boxtimes$ makes $\lincat(A)$ weakly monoidal, can define tensor cats, module cats etc etc.

\subsection{The symmetric monoidal 2-categories of tensor categories and bimodule categories}

Let $TC(A)$ be the collection of all sextuples $(X, \otimes, \mathbf{1}, \alpha, \ell, r)$ where $X \in \lincat(A)$,  $\otimes: \Delta^*(X \boxtimes X) \to X$, $\mathbf{1}: \Vect \to X$, $\alpha$, $\ell$, $r$ are the associator and unitors, satisfying the usual conditions. 

}




%Fix a finite set $A$. This gives rise to a functor $j_A: \Delta \to \Gamma$ which sends the ordered set $[m]$ to the set $\sqcup_m A = \{ (a,i) \; | \; a \in A, \; 0 < i \leq m \} $, and sends $f: [m] \to [n]$ to the function $ (a,i) \mapsto \{ (a,j) \in \sqcup_n A \; | \; f(i-1) < j \leq f(i) \}$. Composing with $\lincat$ gives a strict simplicial 2-category. In particular for each object $X \in \lincat(\sqcup_n A)$ and each $\varphi: [m] \to [n]$ in $\Delta$, we obtain an object $\varphi^*X \in \lincat(\sqcup_m A)$.

%Another important simplicial 2-category, is the terminal simplcial 2-category, which is the constant functor with value the terminal 2-category $pt$. A semi-lax natural transformation from $pt$ to $\lincat \circ j_A$ consists of a family of objects $\{ X_n \in \lincat(\sqcup_n A)\}$ together with functors $X_\varphi: \varphi^*X_n \to X_m$ and natural isomorphisms $\phi_{\varphi, \psi}: X_\varphi \circ \varphi^* X_\psi \cong X_{\psi \varphi}$ for each $\varphi: [m] \to [n]$ and $\psi: [n] \to [p]$ in $\Delta$. These natural isomorphisms are required to satisfy the pentagon identity. There is a 2-category of such natural transformations. 

%For each $1 \leq i \leq n$, let $s_i: [1] \to [n]$ denote the {\em Segal inclusion} which maps $0\mapsto i-1$, and $1 \mapsto i$. 
%
%\begin{definition}
%	A {\em tensor category} in $\lincat(A)$ is a semi-lax natural transformation $X: pt \to \lincat \circ j_A$ such that the functors $X_{s_i}: s_i^*X_n \to X_1$ are equivalences. 
%\end{definition}
%
%In the case that $A = (1) = \{1\}$, this is essentially equivalent to the usual notion of a tensor category. 








%There is a functor $\varphi:\Delta \to \Gamma$, which sends $[m]$ to the set $(m) = \{ 1, 2, \dots, m\}$, and sends $f: [m] \to [n]$ to the function $\varphi_f: i \in (m) \mapsto \{ j \in (n) \; | \: f(i-1) < j \leq f(i) \}$.


%The first significant advantage of $n$-fold Segal categories follows from the fact that the homotopy fiber product over a discrete base, for example $X_m \times_{X_0}^h X_n$ when $X$ is an $n$-fold Segal category, agrees with the ordinary fiber product. Thus we many avoid a lengthly discussion of the model structure of $n$-fold complete Segal spaces and work directly with ordinary fiber products.

%We must also identify the weak equivalences between $n$-fold Segal categories. These admit a fairly direct inductive description in terms of the homotopy category $hX$ of an $n$-fold Segal category.

%The {\em homotopy pull-back} of $n$-fold simplicial spaces may be inductively defined as follows.

%	We now inductively define a class of objects called {\em $n$-fold Segal spaces} as well as a collection of maps of $n$-fold Segal spaces called {\em weak equivalences}.

\subsection{The $\Gamma$-$3$-fold Segal Category of Tensor Categories}


The 3-fold Segal Category of tensor categories is first constructed as a simplicial object $TC$ in the 1-category of strict 2-categories (and strict 2-functors). The 3-fold Segal category is then obtained by applying the above 2-categorical nerve levelwise. For each $[n] \in \Delta$ we have a strict 2-category $TC_n$ defined as follows. The objects, 1-morphism, and 2-morphisms of $TC_n$ correspond to certain labelings of the $n$-simplex $[n]$. The objects of $TC_n$ consist of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For each vertex $i$ of $[n]$, a tensor category $A_i$. 
	\item For each edge $ij$ of $[n]$, an $A_i$-$A_j$-bimodule category $M_{ij}$.
	\item For each 2-simplex $ijk$ of $[n]$, an $A_j$-balanced functor of $A_i$-$A_k$-bimodule categories 
	\begin{equation*}
		\varphi_{ijk}: M_{ij} \times M_{jk} \to M_{ijk},
	\end{equation*}
	 which realizes $M_{ik}$ as the tensor product $M_{ik} \simeq M_{ij} \otimes_{A_j} M_{jk}$. 
	\item For each 3-simplex $ijk\ell$ of $[n]$, a natural transformation of $A_j$/$A_k$-balanced $A_i$-$A_\ell$-bimodule functors 
	\begin{equation*}
		\alpha_{ijk \ell}: \varphi_{i k \ell} \circ (\varphi_{ijk} \times id_{M_{k\ell}}) \to \varphi_{ij \ell} \circ (id_{M_{ij}} \times \varphi_{jk\ell}).
	\end{equation*}
	 %inducing the identity natural isomorphism of the canonical equivalence $(M_{ij} \otimes_{A_j} M_{jk}) \otimes_{A_k} M_{k\ell} \simeq M_{ij} \otimes_{A_j}( M_{jk} \otimes_{A_k} M_{k\ell}).$
	\item such that for each $4$-simplex $ijk\ell m$ of $[n]$, the following pentagon identity is satisfied:
	\begin{align*}
		\text{(to be added)}  \\ [\varphi_{ijm} * (id_{M_{ij}} \times \alpha_{jk\ell m})] \circ [\alpha_{ij\ell m} * (id_{M_{ij}} \times \varphi_{jk\ell} \times id_{M_{\ell m}})] \circ [\varphi_{i \ell m} * ( \alpha_{ijk \ell} \times id_{M_{\ell m}})] = ...
	\end{align*} \CSPcomm{Need to finish the pentagon equation.}
\end{itemize}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two objects in $TC_n$. The 1-morphisms of $TC_n$ from $X$ to $Y$ consist of labeled $n$-simplices where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For each vertex $i$ of $[n]$, the tensor category $A_i^X$ and $A^Y_i$ agree identically. 
	\item For each edge $ij$ of $[n]$, an $A_i$-$A_j$-bimodule functor

Let $A$ be a finite set. Let $P(A)$ denote the power set of $A$, viewed as a poset via inclusion. Define $TC(n,A)$ to be the full sub-2-category of the strict functor 2-category $Fun(P(A), TC_n)$ consisting of those functors, natural transformations, and modifications which satisfy the following conditions. If $S_0$ and $S_1$ are disjoint subsets of $A$, then the induced map 
\begin{equation*}
	X(S_0) \times X(S_1) \to X(S_0 \sqcup S_1) \quad \text{ (need to finish)}
\end{equation*} 
\CSPcomm{Wait, don't the morphism in $TC_n$ fix the vertex tensor categories by definition? So then an inclusion doesn't correspond to a map in $TC_n$?}

If $f:A \to P(B)$ is a morphism in $\Gamma$, then we get a functor $f^*: TC(n, B) \to TC(n,A)$ which on objects sends $X \in TC(n,B)$ to the assignment $f^*X(S) = X( \cup_{s \in S} f(s))$. Since $f$ sends disjoint unions to disjoint unions, this formula does indeed define an object of $TC(n,A)$. 

\CSPcomm{Maybe I should reverse the order of these discussions. First discuss $P(A)$ and construct "bilinear sequences" which would consist of sequences of objects linear categories index by the subsets of $A$, and satisfying the "Deligne condition" for disjoint unions. (is this the right term? Maybe Segal condition?). Then show this has its own Deligne tensor product (essentially objectwise). So then we get the notion of tensor object and also module and bimodule objects which consist of sequences of tensor categories or bimodule categories. Finally We can just export the above definition be replacing $X$ and its ilk by objects in the $A$ sequences. Lastly, we just need to observe that this gives a  Gamma simplicial 2-category.}

%--------- \CSPcomm{I need to edit the below.}

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item The $0^\text{th}$ 2-category is the discrete collection tensor categories viewed as a discrete 2-category. 
%	\item The $1^\text{st}$ 2-category consists of the disjoint union over all pairs of tensor categories $A$ and $B$ of the 2-categories of $A$-$B$-bimodule categories, functors, and natural transformations. 
%	\item The $2^\text{nd}$ 2-category consists of a disjoint union over all triples of tensor categories $A$, $B$, $C$ of certain 2-categories $TC_2(A,B,C)$. These 2-categories consists of triples of bimodules $ \bimod{A}{L}{B}$, $ \bimod{B}{M}{C}$, $ \bimod{A}{N}{C}$, together with a $B$-balanced $A$-$C$-linear functor $L \times M \to N$ inducing an equivalence $\bimod{A}{L \boxtimes_B M }{C} \cong  \bimod{A}{N }{C}$. The 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms are the obvious ones.

A symmetric monoidal category is the same as a functor $Fin_* \to \Cat$ which sends coproducts to products. A symmetric monoidal 3-category is a functor $Fin_* \to 3\text{-}\Cat$ which sends coproducts to products.

\begin{remark}
It is worth keeping in mind, and separating, the two key conceptual differences between the setting of tensor categories and the setting of ordinary algebra.  The first difference is, obviously, that we have categorified---the underlying objects are now longer sets but categories.  The second difference is that the elements of the objects no longer have additive inverses---that is objects of a tensor category, unlike elements of an algebra, needn't be additively invertible.  For many purposes and arguments, the second is the more serious and problematic difference.
